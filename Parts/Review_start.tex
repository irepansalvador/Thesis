During the last decades the scientific community has witnessed the flourishing of modern developmental biology (although developmental biology can not be considered a young scientific discipline, as its roots come from centuries ago from embryology and anatomy). Since the 1980's crucial discoveries \citep{Gilbert1998} have improved our understanding of the developmental process in many model organisms.

Most of the modern developmental biology studies use an "individualistic" approach \citep{Davidson2009}, e.g., focusing only on the description of some gene's effect on the development of a specific structure or the role of a gene in a specific signalling pathway.

This "individualistic" approach, although having increased substantially the knowledge in the developmental biology field, it can be complemented with a systemic statistical approach, that could serve to find interesting general patterns. \textbf{QUEREMOS SABER LAS PROPIEDADES GENERALES DEL DESARROLLO} 

For example, in the early 80's, as techniques to identify whether a gene is expressed in a specific stage of development or tissue became available (e.g., \citet{Bialojan1984}), lead to an many studies showing the expression of one gene (or genes from a gene family) during development. The characterization of the spatial or temporal expression of a gene during development allowed the determination of the link between gene products and their molecular function \textbf{ESTO DEL LINK MOLECULAR O CAMBIARLO O MODIFICARLO}.
More recently with the emergence of methods like DNA microarrays (which extended the determination of the expression of a single gene to a genomic level) systemic approaches of gene expression during development have served to identify groups of temporal co-expressing genes \citep{Arbeitman2002}. Also, high-throughput analysis of mRNA hybridization have allowed the classification of developmental genes based on their tissue-specificity \citep{Tomancak2007}. 
\textbf{CITAR LO DE TEMPORAL Y Q NO HAY ESPACIAL. FRISE ONLY FATE.}

In this work, I have analysed publicly accessible spatio-temporal gene expression data of two model organisms, \textit{Drosophila melanogaster} and \textit{Ciona intestinalis}, together with population genomics data of \textit{D. melanogaster}.
Using a statistical approach, I address three questions:
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{enumerate}
\item How do complexity and compartmentalization increase in the embryo during development?
\item Can adaptation be found in specific anatomical parts of the embryo or developmental stages? 
\item Is the Hourglass model (which states that there is less amount of inter-specific variation in mid-development; see section \ref{hourglass}) supported by evidence of natural selection at the DNA sequence level?
\end{enumerate}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

These questions have been selected for the great interest they have aroused in the scientific community since the early days of developmental and evolutionary biology.

The work presented here is based on and uses concepts from three main biology fields: 
developmental biology, evolutionary biology and population genetics.
Nowadays, the combination of these scientific fields constitute multiple research programmes. Modern evolutionary developmental biology (evo-devo) is the explicit combination of the first two fields.

%However, these fields have not always gone hand in hand. Some decades ago, there was a clear conceptual and epistemological separation between evolutionary biology (mostly practised by geneticists) and developmental biology, even though embryology (which slowly transformed into developmental biology in the middle of the 20th century, see \citealp{Horder2010}) was considered crucial for the study of evolution in the 19th century.

%In the following section, I will give a brief introduction of the scientific and philosophical origins of developmental biology, with special attention to its relations with evolutionary biology and genetics (for a comprehensive review on this issue, see: \citealp{amundson2005changing}; \citealp{gilbert1991conceptual}), and to some of the concepts I will use in this dissertation.

Before I talk about complexity and adaptation in development, it might be useful to define what development is, so first, I will address this apparently simple question.
