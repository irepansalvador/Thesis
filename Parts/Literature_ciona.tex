	The ascidian \textit{Ciona intestinalis}, a marine invertebrate animal, has a long history in developmental biology and evolutionary biology. 
	Darwin highlighted the importance of the ascidians due to their close phylogenetic relationship to the vertebrates \citep{Darwin20009}. Also, it provided one of the first evidences of localized determinants of cell specification \citep{Conklin1905}. Although their adult form is a sessile filter feeder, its tadpole larva has characteristic features of the chordate group: a dorsal neural tube, a notochord surrounded by muscle and a ventral endodermal strand \cite{Satoh2003}.
	
	Some features of \textit{C. intestinalis} development that attracted the attention of developmental biologists more than a century ago \citep{kowalewski1866entwicklungsgeschichte,chabry1887contribution} included: its easy to collect, it has a rapid embryonic development (it takes less than 20 hours from the fertilized egg to the larva), and its invariant cell lineage and similitude between the ascidian larva and the vertebrate tadpole.
	More recently, the almost transparent body, which facilitate many genetic techniques, and the sequencing of the \textit{C. intestinalis} genome \citep{Dehal2002} are partly responsible for the re-emergence of \textit{C. intestinalis} as model organism in developmental biology \citep{Levin2012}.
	
The sequencing of \textit{C. intestinalis} genome facilitades the study of gene expression data during its life cycle \citep{Azumi2007}. Relevant efforts have been made to describe the spatial expression patterns of individual genes during embryogenesis \citep{Satou2001,Fujiwara2002,Kusakabe2002,Imai2004,Miwata2006}, making this an invaluable resource to investigate the spatio-temporal dynamics of gene expression. Taking advantage of the ascidian invariant cleavage pattern and well described lineage analysis \citep{Conklin1905,Nishida1987}, the spatial expression of many genes have been described at the single cell level up to the early gastrula stage.
This allowed \citet{Imai2006} to determine the distribution of most of transcription factors and signaling molecules at single-cell resolution for every cell of the \textit{C. intestinalis} early embryo, which they used then to deduce regulatory networks in the early embryo \citep{Imai2006}.

%	The \textit{C. intestinalis} genome is only 160Mb and contains ~16,000 genes, a gene number similar to the invertebrate \textit{D. melanogaster} genome and only is half of the genes found in some vertebrates (REF).
%	This low number of genes (compared to vertebrates) can be explained by the finding that many gene families or subfamilies have only one representative in \textit{C. intestinalis} \citep{Dehal2002}.

\subsection{\textit{Ciona intestinalis} life cycle}

%\subsubsection{Developmental stages}

Ascidians, or tunicates (named after the "tunic" or thick cover in the adult form), are sessile animals that  attach to rocks and shells and filter plankton and other nutrients from seawater \citep{satoh2014developmental}.
During embryogenesis, ascidians show morphogenetic movements during gastrulation and neurulation similar to vertebrates and both share common genetic regulators of cell specification \citep{Satoh2003}. Its embryonic development is bilaterally symmetric, with invariant cell-lineage and tightly regulated cell division rates \citep{Stolfi2015}.
%
As mentioned before, its larval form resembles a (simplified version of the) vertebrate tadpole. The larva is commonly divided in "trunk" (anterior part) and "tail" (posterior part). The trunk contains the anterior central nervous system (CNS), peripheral nervous system (PNS), and undifferentiated mesoderm and endoderm. 
	\nomenclature{PNS}{Peripheral Nervous System}
The tail is composed of caudal CNS and PNS, notochord, muscle the endodermal strand \citep{Stolfi2015}.
Embryonic development can be divided in cleavage, gastrula, neurula and tailbud stages \citep{Hotta2007}. In Table 2, these embryonic stages are briefly described for \textit{C. intestinalis}, with the developmental time at 18$^\circ$C, based on \citep{Hotta2007}. Table 2 can be used as a reference when mentioning specific developmental stages in \textit{C. intestinalis} in this work.


\subsection{The ANISEED database}

The ANISEED database version 2015 integrates expression data from large-scale in situ hybridization studies with embryo anatomical data of ascidians \citep{Brozovic2016}. The 2015 version represents a considerably improvement from the ANISEED version 2010 \citep{Tassy2010}. Previously, there were ontologies for each stage, with equivalent terms having different IDs in each stage, making the comparison between stages more difficult. The data accessibility has also improved considerably, as the new database version contains all ISH data for \textit{C. intestinalis} in a single parsable XML file, more amenable to computational analysis.

This database includes 27,707 \textit{Ciona intestinalis} gene expression profiles by in situ hybridisation for approximately 4500 genes acquired from more than 200 manually curated articles \citep{Brozovic2016}.
%
The expression data is represented using an ontology-based anatomic description of the embryos. The ANISEED database also includes expression data from the Ghost database in \textit{Ciona intestinalis} \citep{Satou2005}, which contains the spatial expression patterns of more than one thousand cDNA clones by whole-mount in situ hybridization at different developmental stages.
%Taking advantage of the invariant ascidian cleavage pattern and well-described lineage analysis \citep{Conklin1905,Nishida1987} the cDNA spatial expression have been described at the single cell level up to the early gastrula stage \citep{Imai2004}.

The ANISEED database also includes biometry data (e.g., volume, surface/volume) and 3D embryo models (at a single-cell resolution) of ascidian embryos until the early gastrula \citep{Tassy2006}. Importantly, combining the gene expression and 3D embyo models at a single cell resolution it is possible to reconstruct the gene expression pattern in 3D, as I did here. 


%As the ANISEED database do not contains 3D embryo models for tailbud stages, in order to do reconstruct the gene expression in 3D in these stages, I used a 3D model of \textit{C. intestinalis} mid tailbud anatomy at a single cell resolution \citep{Nakamura2012}(see methods and study II).
