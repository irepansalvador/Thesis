abstract = {We discuss the changing use of epigenetics, a term coined by Conrad Waddington in the 1940s, and how the epigenetic approach to development differs from the genetic approach. Originally, epigenetics referred to the study of the way genes and their products bring the phenotype into being. Today, it is primarily concerned with the mechanisms through which cells become committed to a particular form or function and through which that functional or structural state is then transmitted in cell lineages. We argue that modern epigenetics is important not only because it has practical significance for medicine, agriculture, and species conservation, but also because it has implications for the way in which we should view heredity and evolution. In particular, recognizing that there are epigenetic inheritance systems through which non-DNA variations can be transmitted in cell and organismal lineages broadens the concept of heredity and challenges the widely accepted gene-centered neo-Darwinian version of Darwinism.},

abstract = {Transposable elements (TEs) constitute a substantial fraction of the genomes of many species, and it is thus important to understand their population dynamics. The strength of natural selection against TEs is a key parameter in understanding these dynamics. In principle, the strength of selection can be inferred from the frequencies of a sample of TEs. However, complicated demographic histories, such as found in Drosophila melanogaster, could lead to a substantial distortion of the TE frequency distribution compared with that expected for a panmictic, constant-sized population. The current methodology for the estimation of selection intensity acting against TEs does not take into account demographic history and might generate erroneous estimates especially for TE families under weak selection. Here, we develop a flexible maximum likelihood methodology that explicitly accounts both for demographic history and for the ascertainment biases of identifying TEs. We apply this method to the newly generated frequency data of the BS family of non-long terminal repeat retrotransposons in D. melanogaster in concert with two recent models of the demographic history of the species to infer the intensity of selection against this family. We find the estimate to differ substantially compared with a prior estimate that was made assuming a model of constant population size. Further, we find there to be relatively little information about selection intensity present in the derived non-African frequency data and that the ancestral African subpopulation is much more informative in this respect. These findings highlight the importance of accounting for demographic history and bear on study design for the inference of selection coefficients generally.},
annote = {They develop a maximul likelihood method that measures the Ns (strength of selection) acting in the insertion of a particular family of transposable elements.

They use estimates of distribution frequency in different populations in Africa and N.America.

They then estimate the expected distribution of frequencies at the time of the split of the subpopulations accordin to 2 different demographic models.

Both models imply a bottleneck in the american population when it split from the african.

And compute the likelihood of observing a TE for a given selection coeffecient.

They found that the american population has very little information about NS because of the bottleneck.
The ML predicted well for African data but not for american data.
And that is better than a previous method from Petrov that did not account for demography.},

abstract = {A major challenge of modern Biology is elucidating the functional consequences of natural mutations. Although we have a good understanding of the effects of laboratory-induced mutations on the molecular- and organismal-level phenotypes, the study of natural mutations has lagged behind. In this work, we explore the phenotypic space and the evolutionary history of a previously identified adaptive transposable element insertion. We first combined several tests that capture different signatures of selection to show that there is evidence of positive selection in the regions flanking FBti0019386 insertion. We then explored several phenotypes related to known phenotypic effects of nearby genes, and having plausible connections to fitness variation in nature. We found that flies with FBti0019386 insertion had a shorter developmental time and were more sensitive to stress, which are likely to be the adaptive effect and the cost of selection of this mutation, respectively. Interestingly, these phenotypic effects are not consistent with a role of FBti0019386 in temperate adaptation as has been previously suggested. Indeed, a global analysis of the population frequency of FBti0019386 showed that climatic variables explain well the FBti0019386 frequency patterns only in Australia. Finally, although FBti0019386 insertion could be inducing the formation of heterochromatin by recruiting HP1a (Heterochromatin Protein 1a) protein, the insertion is associated with upregulation of sra in adult females. Overall, our integrative approach allowed us to shed light on the evolutionary history, the relevant fitness effects, and the likely molecular mechanisms of an adaptive mutation and highlights the complexity of natural genetic variants.},

They did not found differences in those traits (hatchability, fecundity, etc).

They found that flies with the TE have an upregulation of one of the genes (in adult females) and that the embryos with the TE develop faster.

They suggest that the positive selection evidence found around the TE is due to the fast development.

They found an active binding site of Heterochromatin Protein 1a, so they say it could be ectopically producing heterochromatin, although they didnt find any evidence of downregulation of genes.},

@article{Reeve1993,
abstract = {Adaptation is and has always been a sloppery concept. Even among contemporary evolutionary biologists there is no consensus about how to identify adaptive traits. Most definition of adaptation incorporate elements of history. Among these, some require that adaptive traits be built by natural selection for their current roles. Others take a phylogenetic perspective and require that adaptations be derived relative to traits of antecedent taxa. Still other definitions require evidence of functional design in the biological machinery underlying the trait, implying the trait, implying a history of selective fine-tuning. The historical definition are most useful for addressing questions about evolutionary history like, "What was the phylogenetic trajectory of a phenotype with current utility?," or "How does a trait's current use relate to its original function?" Historical definitions are less useful for addressing questions about phenotype existence like, "Why do certain phenotypes predominate over others in nature?" This is because history-laden definitions often fail to classify as adaptations traits that are maintained by natural selection. Obviously it is important to employ a definition that is appropriate for the research question being pursued. Indeed, the (mis)application of history-laden definitions to questions of phenotype-existence has created the illusion that nonadaptive traits abound in nature and caused widespread about the importance of natural selection in molding phenotypes. To circumvent these problems we propose a nonhistorical definition of adaptation. In our view, an adaptation is a phenotypic variant that results in the highest fitness among a specified set of variants in a given environment. This definition treats adaptation as a relative concept, sets forth operational criteria for identifying the phenotypic traits to which the concept applies, and decouples adaptations from the evolutionary mechanism that generate them. Natural selection theory predicts that among a specific set of alternatives the most adapted phenotype will be the one that predominates in a given environment. This is a testable proposition. When it is false the frequency of the trait must be due to nonselective processes such as drift, migration, selection acting on a correlated trait, or recent changes in the environment. Teleonomic demonstrations of adaptation are a special case of our suggested analysis because inferring a trait's "function" implies the application of a specific fitness criterion (e.g., optimal design) to rank alternative phenotypes. The logical structure of our definition allows us to confront five recent challenges to adaptationism, namely that: (1) it is impossible to identify adaptative traits without a knowledge of phylogeny, which can reveal constraints on adaptation, (2) genetic correlations among different traits usually prevent or retard ascent toward adaptive peaks, (3) "developmental constraints" limit the operation of natural selection, (4) the complex and highly ordered phenotypes studied by adaptationists can be explained most parsimoniously as manifestations of simple mechanisms, and without reference to natural selection, and (5) it is impossible to study the adaptive significance of human behavior because natural selection has not had time to operate on humans in our "changed" environments. We show that these challenges rest on inadequate specification of the components of adaptation.},

abstract = {Developmental constraints (defined as biases on the production of variant phenotypes or limitations on phenotypic variability caused by the structure, character, composition, or dynamics of the developmental system) undoubtedly play a significant role in evolution. Yet there is little agreement on their importance as compared with selection, drift, and other such factors in shaping evolutionary history. This review distinguishes between "universal" and "local" constraints; it deals primarily with the latter, which apply to a limited range of taxa. Such constraints, typically, can be broken even within the taxa to which they apply, though with varying degrees of difficulty. The origin of constraints is discussed, five distinctive of constraint being explicitly considered. Three means of identifying constraints are set forth, as well as four means of distinguishing developmental from selective constraints. None of the latter (use of a priori adaptive predictions, direct measurement of selection, direct measurement of heritable variation, and use of the comparative method) is foolproof. In the final section, three larger issues regarding the role of developmental constraints in evolution are discussed: the extent to which evolutionary stasis can be explained in developmental terms, the extend to which evolutionary trends and patterns might be a consequence of developmental constraints, and the extent to which various genetic and developmental mechanisms have evolved in virtue of the need of lineages to manifest evolutionary plasticity (or adaptability) if they are to survive. Although no definitive conclusions are reached on these larger issues, we bring recent advances in developmental biology, evolutionary theory, and (to a limited extent) molecular biology to bear on them.},

The partial characterization of this gene cluster revealed the presence of two novel genes (Hox-5.2, Hox-5.3) located at the 5' extremity of this complex. In situ hybridization experiments showed that these two genes are transcribed in very posterior domains during embryonic and foetal development. We also show that Hox-1.6, the gene located at the 3' most position in the HOX-1 complex, has a very anterior expression boundary during early development. These results clearly support the recently proposed hypothesis that the expression of murine Antp-like homeobox-containing genes along the antero-posterior developing body axis follows a positional hierarchy which reflects their respective physical positions within the HOX clusters, similar to that which is found for the Drosophila homeotic genes. Such a structural and functional organization is likely conserved in most vertebrates. Moreover, on the basis of sequence comparisons, we propose that the ordering of homeobox-containing genes within clusters has been conserved between Drosophila and the house mouse. Thus, very different body plans might be achieved, both in insects and vertebrates, by evolutionarily conserved gene networks possibly displaying similar regulatory interactions.},

@article{Gould1979,
abstract = {An adaptationist programme has dominated evolutionary thought in England and the United States during the past 40 years. It is based on faith in the power of natural selection as an optimizing agent. It proceeds by breaking an organism into unitary 'traits' and proposing an adaptive story for each considered separately. Trade-offs among competing selective demands exert the only brake upon perfection; non-optimality is thereby rendered as a result of adaptation as well. We criticize this approach and attempt to reassert a competing notion (long popular in continental Europe) that organisms must be analysed as integrated wholes, with Bauplane so constrained by phyletic heritage, pathways of development and general architecture that the constraints themselves become more interesting and more important in delimiting pathways of change than the selective force that may mediate change when it occurs. We fault the adaptationist programme for its failure to distinguish current utility from reasons for origin (male tyrannosaurs may have used their diminutive front legs to titillate female partners, but this will not explain why they got so small); for its unwillingness to consider alternatives to adaptive stories; for its reliance upon plausibility alone as a criterion for accepting speculative tales; and for its failure to consider adequately such competing themes as random fixation of alleles, production of non-adaptive structures by developmental correlation with selected features (allometry, pleiotropy, material compensation, mechanically forced correlation), the separability of adaptation and selection, multiple adaptive peaks, and current utility as an epiphenomenon of non-adaptive structures. We support Darwin's own pluralistic approach to identifying the agents of evolutionary change.},

I have therefore deliberately limited myself here to presenting a broad general view of the problem, emphasizing in particular well-established facts which require explanation, and only selecting from recent work those experiments whose implications seem likely to be of lasting significance. Much very recent work, often of great interest, has been omitted because its implications are not clear. I have also tried to relate the problem to the other central problems of molecular biology-those of gene action and nucleic acid synthesis. In short, I have written for the biologist rather than the biochemist, the general reader rather than the specialist.

abstract = {Heterochrony has often been proposed as a leading mechanism for macroevolutionary change in morphology of organisms, based simply on a relative shift in the timing of events during embryonic development in the evolving organisms. Its most recent formulation was in Gould's ‘clock model'. Such timing shifts were seen as being controlled genetically (by ‘rate genes') or by hormones (such as thyroxine). Heterochrony has much in common with the concept of allometry. The concept originated in the context of the idea of recapitulation where embryonic development was interpreted as a repetition of the organism's evolutionary history but in accelerated form; deviations from this recapitulation were identified as instances of heterochrony. In a later version used to explain macroevolutionary change (paedomorphosis), a new adult morphology is derived from ancestral larval forms by truncation of ancestral adult stages. However, it is difficult to see how genuine structural novelty can be explained, given that timing changes during development can in themselves do no more than redeploy preexisting characters. The explanatory value of the concept of heterochrony is increasingly questioned; at best it only indirectly relates to, or identifies, specific underlying mechanisms. It is in effect a form of redescription.},

abstract = {Developmental biology – or ‘embryology' – is a subject with a long and distinguished, but uneven, history. It is remarkable for the list of leading scientists and philosophers who have contributed to it from antiquity up to the present era. Because embryos are typically minute and inaccessible direct study and understanding has been slow and relatively recent: before the mid‐nineteenth century theories of reproduction and the origin of living forms were largely speculative. Since then embryology has varied greatly in its importance within mainline biological thinking. At one time it provided key evidence for evolution; later for early theories of genetics. Recently, and even now it can be argued, biologists are divided and unclear about how best to demarcate the subject because it overlaps with many other biological themes as diverse as reproduction, malformation, aging and cancer. Today it tends to be approached through the techniques of molecular biology and molecular genetics, and has acquired renewed interest in the context of fertility enhancement, stem cells and genetic engineering.},

This new perspective challenges several popular views about the history of evolutionary thought by claiming that many earlier authors made history come out right for the Evolutionary Synthesis. The book starts with a revised history of nineteenth-century evolutionary thought. It then investigates how development became irrelevant to evolution with the Evolutionary Synthesis.

@article{Hudson2007,
abstract = {The ascidian neural plate has a grid-like organisation, with six rows and eight columns of aligned cells, generated by a series of stereotypical cell divisions. We have defined unique molecular signatures for each of the eight cells in the posterior-most two rows of the neural plate - rows I and II. Using a combination of morpholino gene knockdown, dominant-negative forms and pharmacological inhibitors, we tested the role of three signalling pathways in defining these distinct cell identities. Nodal signalling at the 64-cell stage was found to be required to define two different neural plate domains - medial and lateral - with Nodal inducing lateral and repressing medial identities. Delta2, an early Nodal target, was found to then subdivide each of the lateral and medial domains to generate four columns. Finally, a separate signalling system along the anteroposterior axis, involving restricted ERK1/2 activation, was found to promote row I fates and repress row II fates. Our results reveal how the sequential integration of three signalling pathways - Nodal, Delta2/Notch and FGF/MEK/ERK - defines eight different sub-domains that characterise the ascidian caudal neural plate. Most remarkably, the distinct fates of the eight neural precursors are each determined by a unique combination of inputs from these three signalling pathways.},

abstract = {In early Ciona savignyi embryos, nuclear localization of {\{}beta{\}}-catenin is the first step of endodermal cell specification, and triggers the activation of various target genes. A cDNA for Cs-FGF4/6/9, a gene activated downstream of {\{}beta{\}}-catenin signaling, was isolated and shown to encode an FGF protein with features of both FGF4/6 and FGF9/20. The early embryonic expression of Cs-FGF4/6/9 was transient and the transcript was seen in endodermal cells at the 16- and 32-cell stages, in notochord and muscle cells at the 64-cell stage, and in nerve cord and muscle cells at the 110-cell stage; the gene was then expressed again in cells of the nervous system after neurulation. When the gene function was suppressed with a specific antisense morpholino oligo, the differentiation of mesenchyme cells was completely blocked, and the fate of presumptive mesenchyme cells appeared to change into that of muscle cells. The inhibition of mesenchyme differentiation was abrogated by coinjection of the morpholino oligo and synthetic Cs-FGF4/6/9 mRNA. Downregulation of {\{}beta{\}}-catenin nuclear localization resulted in the absence of mesenchyme cell differentiation due to failure of the formation of signal-producing endodermal cells. Injection of synthetic Cs-FGF4/6/9 mRNA in {\{}beta{\}}-catenin-downregulated embryos evoked mesenchyme cell differentiation. These results strongly suggest that Cs-FGF4/6/9 produced by endodermal cells acts an inductive signal for the differentiation of mesenchyme cells. On the other hand, the role of Cs-FGF4/6/9 in the induction of notochord cells is partial; the initial process of the induction was inhibited by Cs-FGF4/6/9 morpholino oligo, but notochord-specific genes were expressed later to form a partial notochord.

abstract = {In the present study, we addressed the role of (beta)-catenin in the specification of embryonic cells of the ascidians Ciona intestinalis and C. savignyi and obtained the following results: (1) During cleavages, (beta)-catenin accumulated in the nuclei of vegetal blastomeres, suggesting that it plays a role in the specification of endoderm. (2) Mis- and/or overexpression of (beta)-catenin induced the development of an endoderm-specific alkaline phosphatase (AP) in presumptive notochord cells and epidermis cells without affecting differentiation of primary lineage muscle cells. (3) Downregulation of (beta)-catenin induced by the overexpression of cadherin resulted in the suppression of endoderm cell differentiation. This suppression was compensated for by the differentiation of extra epidermis cells. (4) Specification of notochord cells did not take place in the absence of endoderm differentiation. Both the overexpression of (beta)-catenin in presumptive notochord cells and the downregulation of (beta)-catenin in presumptive endoderm cells led to the suppression of Brachyury gene expression, resulting in the failure of notochord specification. These results suggest that the accumulation of (beta)-catenin in the nuclei of endoderm progenitor cells is the first step in the process of ascidian endoderm specification.},

abstract = {In the ascidian embryo, the nerve cord and notochord of the tail of tadpole larvae originate from the precursor blastomeres for both tissues in the 32-cell-stage embryo. Each fate is separated into two daughter blastomeres at the next cleavage. We have examined mechanisms that are responsible for nerve cord and notochord specification through experiments involving blastomere isolation, cell dissociation, and treatment with basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and inhibitors for the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade. It has been shown that inductive cell interaction at the 32-cell stage is required for notochord formation. Our results show that the nerve cord fate is determined autonomously without any cell interaction. Presumptive notochord blastomeres also assume a nerve cord fate when they are isolated before induction is completed. By contrast, not only presumptive notochord blastomeres but also presumptive nerve cord blastomeres forsake their default nerve cord fate and choose the notochord fate when they are treated with bFGF. When the FGF-Ras-MAPK signaling cascade is inhibited, both blastomeres choose the default nerve cord pathway, supporting the results of blastomere isolation. Thus, binary choice of alternative fates and asymmetric division are involved in this nerve cord/notochord fate determination system, mediated by FGF signaling.

Thus, the activity of a Sox protein is dependent upon the identity of its partner factor and the context of the DNA sequence to which it binds. In this Primer, we provide an mechanistic overview of how Sox family proteins function, as a paradigm for transcriptional regulation of development involving multi-transcription factor complexes, and we discuss how Sox factors can thus regulate diverse processes during development.},

abstract = {The general requirement to induce mesoderm and allocate cells into different mesodermal tissues such as body muscle or heart is common in many animal embryos. Since the discovery of the twist gene, there has been great progress toward unraveling the molecular mechanisms that control mesoderm specification and differentiation. Twist was first identified in Drosophila as a gene crucial for proper gastrulation and mesoderm formation. In the fly embryo, Twist continues to play additional roles, allocating mesodermal cells into the body wall muscle fate and patterning a subset of these muscles. Twist is also required for proper differentiation of the adult musculature. Twist homologues have been identified in a great variety of organisms, which span the phylogenetic tree. These organisms include other invertebrates such as jellyfish, nematode, leech and lancelet as well as vertebrates such as frog, chick, fish, mouse and human. The Twist family shares both homology in structure across the basic helix-loop-helix domain and in expression during mesoderm and muscle development in most species. Here we review the current state of knowledge of the Twist family and consider how Twist functions during development. Moreover, we highlight experimental evidence that shows common themes that Twist employs during specification and patterning of the mesoderm among evolutionarily distant organisms. Conserved principles and the molecular mechanisms underlying them are discussed.},

abstract = {Developmental transcription factors are key players in animal multicellularity, being members of the T-box family that are among the most important. Until recently, T-box transcription factors were thought to be exclusively present in metazoans. Here, we report the presence of T-box genes in several nonmetazoan lineages, including ichthyosporeans, filastereans, and fungi. Our data confirm that Brachyury is the most ancient member of the T-box family and establish that the T-box family diversified at the onset of Metazoa. Moreover, we demonstrate functional conservation of a homolog of Brachyury of the protist Capsaspora owczarzaki in Xenopus laevis. By comparing the molecular phenotype of C. owczarzaki Brachyury with that of homologs of early branching metazoans, we define a clear difference between unicellular holozoan and metazoan Brachyury homologs, suggesting that the specificity of Brachyury emerged at the origin of Metazoa. Experimental determination of the binding preferences of the C. owczarzaki Brachyury results in a similar motif to that of metazoan Brachyury and other T-box classes. This finding suggests that functional specificity between different T-box classes is likely achieved by interaction with alternative cofactors, as opposed to differences in binding specificity.},

abstract = {In a previous analysis of 2300 mRNAs via whole-mount fluorescent in situ hybridization in cellularizing Drosophila embryos, we found that 70{\%} of the transcripts exhibited some form of subcellular localization. To see whether this prevalence is unique to early Drosophila embryos, we examined ∼8000 transcripts over the full course of embryogenesis and ∼800 transcripts in late third instar larval tissues. The numbers and varieties of new subcellular localization patterns are both striking and revealing. In the much larger cells of the third instar larva, virtually all transcripts observed showed subcellular localization in at least one tissue. We also examined the prevalence and variety of localization mechanisms for {\textgreater}100 long noncoding RNAs. All of these were also found to be expressed and subcellularly localized. Thus, subcellular RNA localization appears to be the norm rather than the exception for both coding and noncoding RNAs. These results, which have been annotated and made available on a recompiled database, provide a rich and unique resource for functional gene analyses, some examples of which are provided.},

abstract = {Many applications in computer graphics require complex, highly detailed models. However, the level of detail actually necessary may vary considerably. To control processing time, it is often desirable to use approximations in place of excessively detailed models. We have developed a surface simplification algorithm which can rapidly produce high quality approximations of polygonal models. The algorithm uses iterative contractions of vertex pairs to simplify models and maintains surface error approximations using quadric matrices. By contracting arbitrary vertex pairs (not just edges), our algorithm is able to join unconnected regions of models. This can facilitate much better approximations, both visually and with respect to geometric error. In order to allow topological joining, our system also supports non-manifold surface models},

@article{Barthe2004,
abstract = {In this paper we extend the standard method to derive and optimize subdivision rules in the vicinity of extraordinary vertices (EV). Starting from a given set of rules for regular control meshes, we tune the extraordinary rules (ER) such that the necessary conditions for C1 continuity are satisfied along with as many necessary C2 conditions as possible. As usually done, our approach sets up the general configuration around an EV by exploiting rotational symmetry and reformulating the subdivision rules in terms of the subdivision matrix' eigencomponents. The degrees of freedom are then successively eliminated by imposing new constraints which allows us, e.g., to improve the curvature behavior around EVs. The method is flexible enough to simultaneously optimize several subdivision rules, i.e., not only the one for the EV itself but also the rules for its direct neighbors. Moreover, it allows us to prescribe the stencils for the ERs and naturally blends them with the regular rules that are applied away from the EV. All the constraints are combined in an optimization scheme that searches in the space of feasible subdivision schemes for a candidate which satisfies some necessary conditions exactly and other conditions approximately. The relative weighting of the constraints allows us to tune the properties of the subdivision scheme according to application specific requirements. We demonstrate our method by tuning the ERs for the well-known Loop scheme and by deriving ERs for a 3-type scheme based on a 6-direction Box-spline.},

abstract = {Ascidian larvae develop mesenchyme cells in their trunk. A fibroblast growth factor (FGF9/16/20) is essential and sufficient for induction of the mesenchyme in Ciona savignyi. We have identified two basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) genes named Twist-like1 and Twist-like2 as downstream factors of this FGF. These two genes are phylogenetically closely related to each other, and were expressed specifically in the mesenchymal cells after the 110-cell stage. Gene-knockdown experiments using a specific morpholino oligonucleotide demonstrated that Twist-like1 plays an essential role in determination of the mesenchyme and that Twist-like2 is a downstream factor of Twist-like1. In addition, both overexpression and misexpression of Twist-like1 converts non-mesenchymal cells to mesenchymal cells. We also demonstrate that the upstream regulatory mechanisms of Twist-like1 are different between B-line mesenchymal cells and the A-line mesenchymal cells called `trunk lateral cells'. FGF9/16/20 is required for the expression of Twist-like1 in B-line mesenchymal precursor cells, whereas FGF, FoxD and another novel bHLH factor called NoTrlc are required for Twist-like1 to be expressed in the A-line mesenchymal precursor cells. Therefore, two different but partially overlapping mechanisms are required for the expression of Twist-like1 in the mesenchymal precursors, which triggers the differentiation of the mesenchyme in Ciona embryos.},

@article{Futschik2005,
abstract = {Clustering is an important tool in microarray data analysis. This unsupervised learning technique is commonly used to reveal structures hidden in large gene expression data sets. The vast majority of clustering algorithms applied so far produce hard partitions of the data, i.e. each gene is assigned exactly to one cluster. Hard clustering is favourable if clusters are well separated. However, this is generally not the case for microarray time-course data, where gene clusters frequently overlap. Additionally, hard clustering algorithms are often highly sensitive to noise. To overcome the limitations of hard clustering, we applied soft clustering which offers several advantages for researchers. First, it generates accessible internal cluster structures, i.e. it indicates how well corresponding clusters represent genes. This can be used for the more targeted search for regulatory elements. Second, the overall relation between clusters, and thus a global clustering structure, can be defined. Additionally, soft clustering is more noise robust and a priori pre-filtering of genes can be avoided. This prevents the exclusion of biologically relevant genes from the data analysis. Soft clustering was implemented here using the fuzzy c-means algorithm. Procedures to find optimal clustering parameters were developed. A software package for soft clustering has been developed based on the open-source statistical language R. The package called Mfuzz is freely available.},

Later, fluorescence segregated into muscle cell primordia, but not into mesenchyme cells. An animal hemisphere cell, b 8.17 also exhibited strong fluorescence and joined a group of muscle primordia, very likely becoming a muscle cell itself. In the tadpole, all the tail muscle cells were fluorescent. Fluorescence was also noticed in nerve cell primordia of the vegetal hemisphere, particularly in the cell A 8.16 whose descendants appeared to become part of the sensory vesicle which was strongly fluorescent in the tadpole.

abstract = {The ascidian embryonic mesenchyme, comprising about 900 cells, forms mesodermal tissues or organs of the adult body after metamorphosis. The mesenchyme originates from the A7.6 [trunk lateral cells (TLCs)], B7.7, and B8.5 blastomeres of the 110-cell stage embryo. Previous studies showed that FGF9/16/20 is required for specification of the mesenchyme in Ciona embryos and that two different (A7.6 and B8.5/B7.7) but partially overlapping molecular mechanisms are associated with the expression of a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor gene, Twist-like1, in the mesenchymal precursors, which triggers the differentiation process of mesenchyme cells. In the present study, we examined whether the three embryonic lineages express the same mesenchyme-specific structural genes under the control of a common mechanism or whether the three lineages are characterized by the expression of genes specific to each of the lineages. We characterized nine mesenchyme-specific genes in Ciona embryos and found that five were expressed in A7.6/B8.5/B7.7, two in B8.5/B7.7, and two in B7.7 only. FGF9/16/20 and Twist-like1 were required for the expression of all the mesenchyme-specific genes, except for three A7.6/B8.5/B7.7-specific genes in A7.6 progenitors. Overexpression of FGF9/16/20 or Twist-like1 upregulated the expression of A7.6/B8.5/B7.7- and B8.5/B7.7-specific genes, while it downregulated the expression of B7.7-specific genes. These results provide evidence that the differentiation of each of the three mesenchyme lineages of Ciona embryos is characterized by the expression of a specific set of genes, whose expression is controlled differentially.},

abstract = {How the genotype translates into the phenotype through development is critical to fully understand the evolution of phenotypes. We propose a novel approach to directly assess how changes in gene expression patterns are associated with changes in morphology using the limb as a case example. Our method combines molecular biology techniques, such as whole-mount in situ hybridization, with image and shape analysis, extending the use of Geometric Morphometrics to the analysis of nonanatomical shapes, such as gene expression domains. Elliptical Fourier and Procrustes-based semilandmark analyses were used to analyze the variation and covariation patterns of the limb bud shape with the expression patterns of two relevant genes for limb morphogenesis, Hoxa11 and Hoxa13. We devised a multiple thresholding method to semiautomatically segment gene domains at several expression levels in large samples of limb buds from C57Bl6 mouse embryos between 10 and 12 postfertilization days. Besides providing an accurate phenotyping tool to quantify the spatiotemporal dynamics of gene expression patterns within developing structures, our morphometric analyses revealed high, non-random, and gene-specific variation undergoing canalization during limb development. Our results demonstrate that Hoxa11 and Hoxa13, despite being paralogs with analogous functions in limb patterning, show clearly distinct dynamic patterns, both in shape and size, and are associated differently with the limb bud shape. The correspondence between our results and already well-established molecular processes underlying limb development confirms that this morphometric approach is a powerful tool to extract features of development regulating morphogenesis. Such multilevel analyses are promising in systems where not so much molecular information is available and will advance our understanding of the genotype-phenotype map. In systematics, this knowledge will increase our ability to infer how evolution modified a common developmental pattern to generate a wide diversity of morphologies, as in the vertebrate limb.},

abstract = {The increased prevalence and affordability of 3D scanning technology is beginning to have significant effects on the research questions and approaches available for studies of morphology. As the current trend of larger and more precise 3D datasets is unlikely to slow in the future, there is a need for efficient and capable tools for high-throughput quantitative analysis of biological shape. The promise and the challenge of implementing relatively automated methods for characterizing surface shape can be seen in the example of dental topographic analysis. Dental topographic analysis comprises a suite of techniques for quantifying tooth surfaces and component features. Topographic techniques have provided insight on mammalian molar form-function relationships and these methods could be applied to address other topics and questions. At the same time implementing multiple complementary topographic methods can have high time and labor costs, and comparability of data formats and approaches is difficult to predict. To address these challenges I present MorphoTester, an open source application for visualizing and quantifying topography from 3D triangulated polygon meshes. This application is Python-based and is free to use. MorphoTester implements three commonly used dental topographic metrics-Dirichlet normal energy, relief index, and orientation patch count rotated (OPCR). Previous OPCR algorithms have used raster-based grid data, which is not directly interchangeable with vector-based triangulated polygon meshes. A 3D-OPCR algorithm is provided here for quantifying complexity from polygon meshes. The efficacy of this metric is tested in a sample of mandibular second molars belonging to four species of cercopithecoid primates. Results suggest that 3D-OPCR is at least as effective for quantifying complexity as previous approaches, and may be more effective due to finer resolution of surface data considered here. MorphoTester represents an advancement in the automated quantification of morphology, and can be modified to adapt to future needs and priorities.},

abstract = {Inferred dietary preference is a major component of paleoecologies of extinct primates. Molar occlusal shape correlates with diet in living mammals, so teeth are a potentially useful structure from which to reconstruct diet in extinct taxa. We assess the efficacy of Dirichlet normal energy (DNE) calculated for molar tooth surfaces for reflecting diet. We evaluate DNE, which uses changes in normal vectors to characterize curvature, by directly comparing this metric to metrics previously used in dietary inference. We also test whether combining methods improves diet reconstructions. The study sample consisted of 146 lower (mandibular) second molars belonging to 24 euarchontan taxa. Five shape quantification metrics were calculated on each molar: DNE, shearing quotient, shearing ratio, relief index, and orientation patch count rotated (OPCR). Statistical analyses were completed for each variable to assess effects of taxon and diet. Discriminant function analysis was used to assess ability of combinations of variables to predict diet. Values differ significantly by diets for all variables, although shearing ratios and OPCR do not distinguish statistically between insectivores and folivores or omnivores and frugivores. Combined analyses were much more effective at predicting diet than any metric alone. Alone, relief index and DNE were most effective at predicting diet. OPCR was the least effective alone but is still valuable as the only quantitative measure of surface complexity. Of all methods considered, DNE was the least methodologically sensitive, and its effectiveness suggests it will be a valuable tool for dietary reconstruction.},

abstract = {Ascidians are invertebrate chordates with a simple larval tadpole form containing a notochord and an overlying dorsal neural tube. As in vertebrates, the neural tube of ascidian larvae displays positional differences along the rostral-caudal and dorsal-ventral axes in terms of neuronal cell types generated, morphology and gene expression. However, how these differences are established in this simple chordate remains largely unknown. In this study, we show that a single blastomere named b6.5, which is situated in a lateral position in the 32-cell-stage embryo, is a source of signal(s) required for patterning across the medial-lateral axis (future ventral-dorsal axis) of the neural plate. We identify this signal as a Ciona homologue of Nodal, Ci-Nodal. Transcriptional activation of Ci-Nodal in b6.5 depends upon vegetally derived Ci-FGF9/16/20. Using three distinct reagents to inhibit Nodal signals, we show that Nodal signalling is required for neural plate patterning across the medial-lateral axis and that, in the absence of this signal, the caudal-lateral part of the neural plate adopts a medial-like fate. Secondary muscle fate is similarly affected. We conclude that specification of the lateral neural plate is initiated by signalling sources laterally flanking the neural plate and involves a cell-fate choice between lateral and medial neural fates, with Nodal signalling promoting lateral fate. This role for Nodal signalling during ascidian neural plate patterning contrasts with that in vertebrates, where it is implicated in promoting a medial neural fate, the floor plate.},

abstract = {Localization of maternal mRNAs in the egg cortex is an essential feature of polarity in embryos of Drosophila, Xenopus and ascidians. In ascidians, maternal mRNAs such as macho 1, a determinant of primary muscle-cell fate, belong to a class of postplasmic RNAs that are located along the animal-vegetal gradient in the egg cortex. Between fertilization and cleavage, these postplasmic RNAs relocate in two main phases. They further concentrate and segregate in small posterior blastomeres into a cortical structure, the centrosome-attracting body (CAB), which is responsible for unequal cleavages. By using high-resolution, fluorescent, in situ hybridization in eggs, zygotes and embryos of Halocynthia roretzi, we showed that macho 1 and HrPEM are localized on a reticulated structure situated within 2 mum of the surface of the unfertilized egg, and within 8 mum of the surface the vegetal region and then posterior region of the zygote. By isolating cortices from eggs and zygotes we demonstrated that this reticulated structure is a network of cortical rough endoplasmic reticulum (cER) that is tethered to the plasma membrane. The postplasmic RNAs macho 1 and HrPEM were located on the cER network and could be detached from it. We also show that macho 1 and HrPEM accumulated in the CAB and the cER network. We propose that these postplasmic RNAs relocalized after fertilization by following the microfilament- and microtubule-driven translocations of the cER network to the poles of the zygote. We also suggest that the RNAs segregate and concentrate in posterior blastomeres through compaction of the cER to form the CAB.

abstract = {The origin of germ cells in the ascidian is still unknown. Previously, we cloned a vasa homologue (CiVH) of Ciona intestinalis from the cDNA library of ovarian tissue by polymerase chain reaction and showed that its expression was specific to germ cells in adult and juvenile gonads. In the present study, we prepared a monoclonal antibody against CiVH protein and traced the staining for this antibody from the middle tailbud stage to young adulthood. Results showed that positive cells are present in the endodermal strand in middle tailbud embryos and larvae. When the larval tail was absorbed into the trunk during metamorphosis, the CiVH-positive cells migrated from the debris of the tail into the developing gonad rudiment, and appeared to give rise to a primordial germ cell (PGC) in the young juvenile. The testis rudiment separated from the gonad rudiment, the remainder of which differentiated into the ovary. PGCs of the testis rudiment and the ovary rudiment differentiated into spermatogenic and oogenic cells, respectively. When the larval tail containing the antibody-positive cells was removed, the juveniles did not contain any CiVH-positive cells after metamorphosis, indicating that the PGCs in the juvenile originated from part of the larval tail. However, even in such juveniles, positive cells newly appeared in the gonad rudiment at a later stage. This observation suggests that a compensatory mechanism regulates germline formation in C. intestinalis.},

abstract = {The tail muscle cells of the ascidian tadpole larva originate from two different lineages, the B- (primary) and A- and b- (secondary) line blastomeres of the eight-cell stage embryo. The primary muscle cells assume muscle fate cell-autonomously with the involvement of a localized muscle determinant, macho-1. On the other hand, fate determination of secondary muscle cells is a non-cell-autonomous process that depends on cellular interactions. In this paper, we investigated the mechanisms underlying fate specification of secondary muscle cells in Halocynthia roretzi. We found that FGF and Wnt5 signals were required. In contrast, the Nodal signal, which is required for specification of A-line muscle cells in another ascidian, Ciona intestinalis, was not necessary for the formation of any secondary muscle cells in Halocynthia embryo. Therefore, Halocynthia and Ciona show distinctly different mechanisms for generation of the secondary lineages, despite the fact that embryogenesis appears very similar between these species. We also found that the mechanisms involved in specification of A- and b-line muscle cells were distinct in that the required timing of the FGF signal for the A-line muscle cells preceded that for the b-line. Moreover, the inducer blastomeres for specification of these two lineages were different.},

abstract = {Asymmetric cell division plays a fundamental role in generating various types of embryonic cell. In ascidian embryos, asymmetric cell divisions occur in the vegetal hemisphere in a manner similar to those found in Caenorhabditis elegans. Early divisions in embryos of both species involve inductive events on a single mother cell that result in production of daughters with different cell fates. Here we show in the ascidian Halocynthia roretzi that polarity of muscle/mesenchyme mother precursors is determined solely by the direction from which the FGF9/16/20 signal is presented, a role similar to that of Wnt signaling in the EMS and T cell divisions in C. elegans. However, polarity of nerve cord/notochord mother precursors is determined by possible antagonistic action between the FGF signal and a signal from anterior ectoderm, providing a new mechanism underlying asymmetric cell division. The ectoderm signal suppresses MAPK activation and expression of Hr-FoxA, which encodes an intrinsic competence factor for notochord induction, in the nerve cord lineage.},

abstract = {Comparison of features of the cell lineages and fate maps of early embryos between related species is useful in inferring developmental mechanisms and amenable to evolutionary considerations. We present cleavage patterns, cell lineage trees, and fate maps of ascidian and appendicularian embryos side by side to facilitate comparison. This revealed a number of significant differences in cleavage patterns and cell lineage trees, whereas the fate maps were found to be conserved. This fate map similarity can be extended to vertebrates, thus representing the fate map characteristics of chordates. Cleavage patterns and cell lineages may have been modified during evolution without any drastic changes in fate maps. Selective pressures that constrain developmental mechanisms at early embryonic stages might not be so strong as long as embryos are still able to generate a chordate-type fate map. Aquatic chordates share similar fate maps and morphogenetic movements during gastrulation and neurulation, eventually developing into tadpole-shaped larvae. As swimming by tail beats, and not by cilia, is advantageous, selective pressure may maintain the basic elements of the tadpole shape. We also discuss the evolutionary origin of the vertebrate neural crest and the embryonic origin of the appendicularian heart to illustrate the usefulness of cell lineage data. From an evolutionary standpoint, cell lineages behave like other characteristics such as morphology or protein sequences. Both novel and primitive features are present in extant organisms, and it is of interest to identify the relative degree of evolutionary conservation as well as the level at which homology is inferred.},

abstract = {Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) induces the notochord and mesenchyme in ascidian embryos, via extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) that belongs to the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family. A cDNA microarray analysis was carried out to identify genes affected by an inhibitor of MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK), U0126, in embryos of the ascidian Ciona intestinalis. Data obtained from the microarray and in situ hybridization suggest that the majority of genes are downregulated by U0126 treatment. Genes that were downregulated in U0126-treated embryos included Ci-Bra and Ci-Twist-like1 that are master regulatory genes of notochord and mesenchyme differentiation, respectively. The plasminogen mRNA was downregulated by U0126 in presumptive endoderm cells. This suggests that a MEK-mediated extracellular signal is necessary for gene expression in tissues whose specification does not depend on cell-to-cell interaction. Among 85 cDNA clusters that were not affected by U0126, 30 showed mitochondria-like mRNA localization in the nerve cord/muscle lineage blastomeres in the equatorial region. The expression level and asymmetric distribution of these mRNA were independent of MEK signaling.},

abstract = {Maternally provided mRNAs and proteins direct early development and activate the zygotic genome. Using microarrays, we examined the dynamics of transcriptomes during the early development of a basal chordate, Ciona intestinalis. Microarray analysis of unfertilized eggs, as well as 8-, and 16- and 32-cell embryos revealed that nearly half of the genes encoded in the genome were expressed maternally, and that approximately only one-fourth of these genes were expressed at similar levels among eggs obtained from different individuals. Genes encoding proteins involved in protein phosphorylation were enriched in this latter group. More than 90{\%} of maternal RNAs were not reduced before the 16-cell stage when the zygotic developmental program begins. Additionally we obtained gene expression profiles of individual blastomeres from the 8- and 16-cell embryos. On the basis of these profiles, we concluded that the posterior-most localization, which has been reported for over 20 different transcripts, is the only major localization pattern of maternal transcripts. Our data also showed that maternal factors establish only nine distinct patterns of zygotic gene expression at the 16-cell stage. Therefore, one of the main developmental functions of maternally supplied information is to establish these nine distinct expression patterns in the 16-cell embryo. The dynamics of transcriptomes in early-stage embryos provides a foundation for studying how maternal information starts the zygotic program.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The draft genome sequence of the ascidian Ciona intestinalis, along with associated gene models, has been a valuable research resource. However, recently accumulated expressed sequence tag (EST)/cDNA data have revealed numerous inconsistencies with the gene models due in part to intrinsic limitations in gene prediction programs and in part to the fragmented nature of the assembly.

RESULTS: We have prepared a less-fragmented assembly on the basis of scaffold-joining guided by paired-end EST and bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) sequences, and BAC chromosomal in situ hybridization data. The new assembly (115.2 Mb) is similar in length to the initial assembly (116.7 Mb) but contains 1,272 (approximately 50{\%}) fewer scaffolds. The largest scaffold in the new assembly incorporates 95 initial-assembly scaffolds. In conjunction with the new assembly, we have prepared a greatly improved global gene model set strictly correlated with the extensive currently available EST data. The total gene number (15,254) is similar to that of the initial set (15,582), but the new set includes 3,330 models at genomic sites where none were present in the initial set, and 1,779 models that represent fusions of multiple previously incomplete models. In approximately half, 5'-ends were precisely mapped using 5'-full-length ESTs, an important refinement even in otherwise unchanged models.

CONCLUSION: Using these new resources, we identify a population of non-canonical (non-GT-AG) introns and also find that approximately 20{\%} of Ciona genes reside in operons and that operons contain a high proportion of single-exon genes. Thus, the present dataset provides an opportunity to analyze the Ciona genome much more precisely than ever.},

abstract = {Changes or innovations in gene regulatory networks for the developmental program in the ancestral chordate genome appear to be a major component in the evolutionary process in which tadpole-type larvae, a unique characteristic of chordates, arose. These alterations may include new genetic interactions as well as the acquisition of new regulatory genes. Previous analyses of the Ciona genome revealed that many genes may have emerged after the divergence of the tunicate and vertebrate lineages. In this paper, we examined this possibility by examining a second non-vertebrate chordate genome. We conclude from this analysis that the ancient chordate included almost the same repertory of regulatory genes, but less redundancy than extant vertebrates, and that approximately 10{\%} of vertebrate regulatory genes were innovated after the emergence of vertebrates. Thus, refined regulatory networks arose during vertebrate evolution mainly as preexisting regulatory genes multiplied rather than by generating new regulatory genes. The inferred regulatory gene sets of the ancestral chordate would be an important foundation for understanding how tadpole-type larvae, a unique characteristic of chordates, evolved.},

abstract = {During asymmetric division, fate determinants at the cell cortex segregate unequally into the two daughter cells. It has recently been shown that Sara (Smad anchor for receptor activation) signalling endosomes in the cytoplasm also segregate asymmetrically during asymmetric division. Biased dispatch of Sara endosomes mediates asymmetric Notch/Delta signalling during the asymmetric division of sensory organ precursors in Drosophila. In flies, this has been generalized to stem cells in the gut and the central nervous system, and, in zebrafish, to neural precursors of the spinal cord. However, the mechanism of asymmetric endosome segregation is not understood. Here we show that the plus-end kinesin motor Klp98A targets Sara endosomes to the central spindle, where they move bidirectionally on an antiparallel array of microtubules. The microtubule depolymerizing kinesin Klp10A and its antagonist Patronin generate central spindle asymmetry. This asymmetric spindle, in turn, polarizes endosome motility, ultimately causing asymmetric endosome dispatch into one daughter cell. We demonstrate this mechanism by inverting the polarity of the central spindle by polar targeting of Patronin using nanobodies (single-domain antibodies). This spindle inversion targets the endosomes to the wrong cell. Our data uncover the molecular and physical mechanism by which organelles localized away from the cellular cortex can be dispatched asymmetrically during asymmetric division.},

abstract = {Multicellularity has emerged and continues to emerge in a variety of lineages and under diverse environmental conditions. In order to attain individuality and integration, multicellular organisms must exhibit spatial cell differentiation, which in turn allows cell aggregates to robustly generate traits and behaviors at the multicellular level. Nevertheless, the mechanisms that may lead to the development of cellular differentiation and patterning in emerging multicellular organisms remain unclear. We briefly review two conceptual frameworks that have addressed this issue: the cooperation-defection framework and the dynamical patterning modules (DPMs) framework. Then, situating ourselves in the DPM formalism first put forward by S. A. Newman and collaborators, we state a hypothesis for cell differentiation and arrangement in cellular masses of emerging multicellular organisms. Our hypothesis is based on the role of the generic cell-to-cell communication and adhesion patterning mechanisms, which are two fundamental mechanisms for the evolution of multicellularity, and whose molecules seem to be well-conserved in extant multicellular organisms and their unicellular relatives. We review some fundamental ideas underlying this hypothesis and contrast them with empirical and theoretical evidence currently available. Next, we use a mathematical model to illustrate how the mechanisms and assumptions considered in the hypothesis we postulate may render stereotypical arrangements of differentiated cells in an emerging cellular aggregate and may contribute to the variation and recreation of multicellular phenotypes.

abstract = {Robust temporal and spatial patterns of cell types emerge in the course of normal development in multicellular organisms. The onset of degenerative diseases may result from altered cell fate decisions that give rise to pathological phenotypes. Complex networks of genetic and non-genetic components underlie such normal and altered morphogenetic patterns. Here we focus on the networks of regulatory interactions involved in cell-fate decisions. Such networks modeled as dynamical non-linear systems attain particular stable configurations on gene activity that have been interpreted as cell-fate states. The network structure also restricts the most probable transition patterns among such states. The so-called Epigenetic Landscape (EL), originally proposed by C. H. Waddington, was an early attempt to conceptually explain the emergence of developmental choices as the result of intrinsic constraints (regulatory interactions) shaped during evolution. Thanks to the wealth of molecular genetic and genomic studies, we are now able to postulate gene regulatory networks (GRN) grounded on experimental data, and to derive EL models for specific cases. This, in turn, has motivated several mathematical and computational modeling approaches inspired by the EL concept, that may be useful tools to understand and predict cell-fate decisions and emerging patterns. In order to distinguish between the classical metaphorical EL proposal of Waddington, we refer to the Epigenetic Attractors Landscape (EAL), a proposal that is formally framed in the context of GRNs and dynamical systems theory. In this review we discuss recent EAL modeling strategies, their conceptual basis and their application in studying the emergence of both normal and pathological developmental processes. In addition, we discuss how model predictions can shed light into rational strategies for cell fate regulation, and we point to challenges ahead.},

A gradient is formed and then interpreted, providing a spatial metric independent of the target tissue, similar to the concept of space in classical mechanics. However, the formation and interpretation of gradients are coupled, dynamic processes. We introduce a conceptual framework for positional specification in which cellular activity feeds back on positional information encoded by gradients, analogous to the feedback between mass-energy distribution and the geometry of space-time in Einstein's general theory of relativity. We discuss how such general relativistic positional information (GRPI) can guide systems-level approaches to pattern formation.},

abstract = {In the vertebrate neural tube, the morphogen Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) establishes a characteristic pattern of gene expression. Here we quantify the Shh gradient in the developing mouse neural tube and show that while the amplitude of the gradient increases over time, the activity of the pathway transcriptional effectors, Gli proteins, initially increases but later decreases. Computational analysis of the pathway suggests three mechanisms that could contribute to this adaptation: transcriptional upregulation of the inhibitory receptor Ptch1, transcriptional downregulation of Gli and the differential stability of active and inactive Gli isoforms. Consistent with this, Gli2 protein expression is downregulated during neural tube patterning and adaptation continues when the pathway is stimulated downstream of Ptch1. Moreover, the Shh-induced upregulation of Gli2 transcription prevents Gli activity levels from adapting in a different cell type, NIH3T3 fibroblasts, despite the upregulation of Ptch1. Multiple mechanisms therefore contribute to the intracellular dynamics of Shh signalling, resulting in different signalling dynamics in different cell types.},

Studies of morphogenesis in embryoid bodies led to the current belief that it is programmed cell death that shapes the epiblast. However, by following embryos developing in vivo and in vitro, we demonstrate that not cell death but a previously unknown morphogenetic event transforms the amorphous epiblast into a rosette of polarized cells. This transformation requires basal membrane-stimulated integrin signaling that coordinates polarization of epiblast cells and their apical constriction, a prerequisite for lumenogenesis. We show that basal membrane function can be substituted in vitro by extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins and that ES cells can be induced to form similar polarized rosettes that initiate lumenogenesis. Together, these findings lead to a completely revised model for peri-implantation morphogenesis in which ECM triggers the self-organization of the embryo's stem cells.},

This widespread adoption has been largely fueled by the emergence of the clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) technology, an important new approach for generating RNA-guided nucleases, such as Cas9, with customizable specificities. Genome editing mediated by these nucleases has been used to rapidly, easily and efficiently modify endogenous genes in a wide variety of biomedically important cell types and in organisms that have traditionally been challenging to manipulate genetically. Furthermore, a modified version of the CRISPR-Cas9 system has been developed to recruit heterologous domains that can regulate endogenous gene expression or label specific genomic loci in living cells. Although the genome-wide specificities of CRISPR-Cas9 systems remain to be fully defined, the power of these systems to perform targeted, highly efficient alterations of genome sequence and gene expression will undoubtedly transform biological research and spur the development of novel molecular therapeutics for human disease.},

We discuss studies of vertebrate hindbrain development that have given important insights into mechanisms that underlie the formation and maintenance of sharp borders. The hindbrain is subdivided into a series of segments with distinct anteroposterior identity that underlies the specification of distinct neuronal cell types. During early stages of segmentation, cell identity switching contributes to the refinement of borders and enables homogenous territories to be maintained despite intermingling of cells between segments. At later stages, there is a specific restriction to cell intermingling between segments that is mediated by Eph receptor and ephrin signaling. Eph-ephrin signaling can restrict cell intermingling and sharpen borders through multiple mechanisms, including the regulation of cell adhesion and contact inhibition of cell migration.},

abstract = {Segregating cells into compartments during embryonic development is essential for growth and pattern formation. Physical mechanisms shaping compartment boundaries were recently explored in Drosophila, where actomyosin-based barriers were revealed to be important for keeping cells apart. In vertebrates, interhombomeric boundaries are straight interfaces, which often serve as signaling centers that pattern the surrounding tissue. Here, we demonstrate that in the hindbrain of zebrafish embryos cell sorting sharpens the molecular boundaries and, once borders are straight, actomyosin barriers are key to keeping rhombomeric cells segregated. Actomyosin cytoskeletal components are enriched at interhombomeric boundaries, forming cable-like structures in the apical side of the neuroepithelial cells by the time morphological boundaries are visible. When myosin II function is inhibited, cable structures do not form, leading to rhombomeric cell mixing. Downregulation of EphA4a compromises actomyosin cables and cells with different rhombomeric identity intermingle, and the phenotype is rescued enhancing myosin II activity. Moreover, enrichment of actomyosin structures is obtained when EphA4 is ectopically expressed in even-numbered rhombomeres. These findings suggest that mechanical barriers act downstream of EphA/ephrin signaling to segregate cells from different rhombomeres.},

abstract = {The structure and projection patterns of adult mesodiencephalic dopaminergic (DA) neurons are one of the best characterized systems in the vertebrate brain. However, the early organization and development of these nuclei remain poorly understood. The induction of midbrain DA neurons requires sonic hedgehog (Shh) from the floor plate and fibroblast growth factor 8 (FGF8) from the isthmic organizer, but the way in which FGF8 regulates DA neuron development is unclear. We show that, during early embryogenesis, mesodiencephalic neurons consist of two distinct populations: a diencephalic domain, which is probably independent of isthmic FGFs; and a midbrain domain, which is dependent on FGFs. Within these domains, DA progenitors and precursors use partly different genetic programs. Furthermore, the diencephalic DA domain forms a distinct cell population, which also contains non-DA Pou4f1(+) cells. FGF signaling operates in proliferative midbrain DA progenitors, but is absent in postmitotic DA precursors. The loss of FGFR1/2-mediated signaling results in a maturation failure of the midbrain DA neurons and altered patterning of the midbrain floor. In FGFR mutants, the DA domain adopts characteristics that are typical for embryonic diencephalon, including the presence of Pou4f1(+) cells among TH(+) cells, and downregulation of genes typical of midbrain DA precursors. Finally, analyses of chimeric embryos indicate that FGF signaling regulates the development of the ventral midbrain cell autonomously.},

@article{Jimenez-Guri2010,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Boundaries that prevent cell movement allow groups of cells to maintain their identity and follow independent developmental trajectories without the need for ongoing instructive signals from surrounding tissues. This is the case of vertebrate rhombomeric boundaries. Analysis in the developing chick hindbrain provided the first evidence that rhombomeres are units of cell lineage. The appearance of morphologically visible rhombomeres requires the segment restricted expression of a series of transcription factors, which position the boundaries and prefigure where morphological boundaries will be established. When the boundaries are established, when the cells are committed to a particular rhombomere and how they are organized within the hindbrain are important questions to our understanding of developmental regionalization.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Sophisticated experimental tools with high-resolution analysis have allowed us to explore cell lineage restriction within the hindbrain in mouse embryos. This novel strategy is based on knock-in alleles of ubiquitous expression and allows unrestricted clonal analysis of cell lineage from the two-cell stage to the adult mouse. Combining this analysis with statistical and mathematical tools we show that there is lineage compartmentalization along the anteroposterior axis from very early stages of mouse embryonic development.

CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that the compartment border coincides with the morphological boundary in the mouse hindbrain. The restriction of the cells to cross rhombomeric boundaries seen in chick is also observed in mouse. We show that the rhombomeric boundaries themselves are involved in cell movement restriction, although an underlying pre-pattern during early embryonic development might influence the way that cell populations organize.},

abstract = {The hindbrain is a vertebrate-specific embryonic structure of the central nervous system formed by iterative transitory units called rhombomeres (r). Rhombomeric cells are segregated by interhombomeric boundaries which are prefigured by sharp gene expression borders. The positioning of the first molecular boundary within the hindbrain (the prospective r4/r5 boundary) responds to the expression of an Iroquois (Irx) gene in the anterior (r4) and the gene vHnf1 at the posterior (r5). However, while Irx3 is expressed anteriorly in amniotes, a novel Irx gene, iro7, acts in teleosts. To assess the evolutionary history of the genes responsible for the positioning of the r4/r5 boundary in vertebrates, we have stepped outside the gnathostomes to investigate these genes in the agnathans Lethenteron japonicum and Petromyzon marinus. We identified one representative of the Hnf1 family in agnathans. Its expression pattern recapitulates that of vHnf1 and Hnf1 in higher vertebrates. Our phylogenetic analysis places this gene basal to gnathostome Hnf1 and vHnf1 genes. We propose that the duplication of an ancestral hnf1 gene present in the common ancestor of agnathans and gnathostomes gave rise to the two genes found in gnathostomes. We have also amplified 3 Irx genes in L. japonicum: LjIrxA, LjIrxC, LjIrxD. The expression pattern of LjIrxA (the agnathan Irx1/3 ortholog) resembles those of Irx3 or iro7 in gnathostomes. We propose that an Irx/hnf1 pair already present in early vertebrates positioned the r4/r5 boundary and that gene duplications occurred in these gene families after the divergence of the agnathans.},

abstract = {Establishing topographical maps of the external world is an important but still poorly understood feature of the vertebrate sensory system. To study the selective innervation of hindbrain regions by sensory afferents in the zebrafish embryo, we mapped the fine-grained topographical representation of sensory projections at the central level by specific photoconversion of sensory neurons. Sensory ganglia located anteriorly project more medially than do ganglia located posteriorly, and this relates to the order of sensory ganglion differentiation. By single-plane illumination microscopy (SPIM) in vivo imaging, we show that (1) the sequence of arrival of cranial ganglion inputs predicts the topography of central projections, and (2) delaminated neuroblasts differentiate in close contact with the neural tube, and they never loose contact with the neural ectoderm. Afferent entrance points are established by plasma membrane interactions between primary differentiated peripheral sensory neurons and neural tube border cells with the cooperation of neural crest cells. These first contacts remain during ensuing morphological growth to establish pioneer axons. Neural crest cells and repulsive slit1/robo2 signals then guide axons from later-differentiating neurons toward the neural tube. Thus, this study proposes a new model by which the topographical representation of cranial sensory ganglia is established by entrance order, with the entry points determined by cell contact between the sensory ganglion cell bodies and the hindbrain.},

abstract = {Segregating cells into compartments during embryonic development is essential for growth and pattern formation. In the developing hindbrain, boundaries separate molecularly, physically and neuroanatomically distinct segments called rhombomeres. After rhombomeric cells have acquired their identity, interhombomeric boundaries restrict cell intermingling between adjacent rhombomeres and act as signaling centers to pattern the surrounding tissue. Several works have stressed the relevance of Eph/ephrin signaling in rhombomeric cell sorting. Recent data have unveiled the role of this pathway in the assembly of actomyosin cables as an important mechanism for keeping cells from different rhombomeres segregated. In this Review, we will provide a short summary of recent evidences gathered in different systems suggesting that physical actomyosin barriers can be a general mechanism for tissue separation. We will discuss current evidences supporting a model where cell-cell signaling pathways, such as Eph/ephrin, govern compartmental cell sorting through modulation of the actomyosin cytoskeleton and cell adhesive properties to prevent cell intermingling.},

abstract = {The vertebrate peripheral nervous system (PNS) originates from neural crest and placodes. While its developmental origin is the object of intense studies, little is known concerning its evolutionary history. To address this question, we analyzed the formation of the larval tail PNS in the ascidian Ciona intestinalis. The tail PNS of Ciona is made of sensory neurons located within the epidermis midlines and extending processes in the overlying tunic median fin. We show that each midline corresponds to a single longitudinal row of epidermal cells and neurons sharing common progenitors. This simple organization is observed throughout the tail epidermis, which is made of only eight single-cell rows, each expressing a specific genetic program. We next demonstrate that the epidermal neurons are specified in two consecutive steps. During cleavage and gastrula stages, the dorsal and ventral midlines are independently induced by FGF9/16/20 and the BMP ligand ADMP, respectively. Subsequently, Delta/Notch-mediated lateral inhibition controls the number of neurons formed within these neurogenic regions. These results provide a comprehensive overview of PNS formation in ascidian and uncover surprising similarities between the fate maps and embryological mechanisms underlying formation of ascidian neurogenic epidermis midlines and the vertebrate median fin.},

abstract = {Ascidian larvae develop after an invariant pattern of embryonic cleavage. Fewer than 400 cells constitute the larval central nervous system (CNS), which forms without either extensive migration or cell death. We catalogue the mitotic history of these cells in Ciona intestinalis, using confocal microscopy of whole-mount embryos at stages from neurulation until hatching. The positions of cells contributing to the CNS were reconstructed from confocal image stacks of embryonic nuclei, and maps of successive stages were used to chart the mitotic descent, thereby creating a cell lineage for each cell. The entire CNS is formed from 10th- to 14th-generation cells. Although minor differences exist in cell position, lineage is invariant in cells derived from A-line blastomeres, which form the caudal nerve cord and visceral ganglion. We document the lineage of five pairs of presumed motor neurons within the visceral ganglion: one pair arises from A/A 10.57, and four from progeny of A/A 9.30. The remaining cells of the visceral ganglion are in their 13th and 14th generations at hatching, with most mitotic activity ceasing around 85{\%} of embryonic development. Of the approximately 330 larval cells previously reported in the CNS of Ciona, we document the lineage of 226 that derive predominantly from A-line blastomeres.},

To address how these processes are coordinated, we analyzed the development of molecularly distinct domains of neural progenitors in the mouse and chick neural tube. We show that during development, these domains undergo changes in size that do not scale with changes in overall tissue size. Our data show that domain proportions are first established by opposing morphogen gradients and subsequently controlled by domain-specific regulation of differentiation rate but not differences in proliferation rate. Regulation of differentiation rate is key to maintaining domain proportions while accommodating both intra- and interspecies variations in size. Thus, the sequential control of progenitor specification and differentiation elaborates pattern without requiring that signaling gradients grow as tissues expand.},

Changes in morphogen signalling and transcriptional networks control the specification of cell types. This is often followed by a distinct second phase, where pattern is elaborated by tissue growth.

Recent studies use biophysical models, genetics, and quantitative imaging to unravel how tissue-level morphogen behavior arises from subcellular events. Moreover, data from several systems show that morphogen gradients, downstream signaling, and the activity of cell-intrinsic transcriptional networks change dynamically during pattern formation. Studies from Drosophila and now also vertebrates suggest that transcriptional network dynamics are central to the generation of gene expression patterns. Together, this leads to the view that pattern formation is an emergent behavior that results from the coordination of events occurring across molecular, cellular, and tissue scales. The development of novel approaches to study this complex process remains a challenge.},

abstract = {Segmentation of the major body axis into repeating units is arguably one of the major inventions in the evolution of animal body plan pattering. It is found in current day vertebrates, annelids and arthropods. Most segmented animals seem to use a clock-and-wavefront type mechanism in which oscillations emanating from a posterior growth zone become transformed into an anterior posterior sequence of segments. In contrast, few animals such as Drosophila use a complex gene regulatory hierarchy to simultaneously subdivide their entire body axis into segments. Here I discuss how in silico models simulating the evolution of developmental patterning can be used to investigate the forces and constraints that helped shape these two developmental modes. I perform an analysis of a series of previous simulation studies, exploiting the similarities and differences in their outcomes in relation to model characteristics to elucidate the circumstances and constraints likely to have been important for the evolution of sequential and simultaneous segmentation modes. The analysis suggests that constraints arising from the involved growth process and spatial patterning signal--posterior elongation producing a propagating wavefront versus a tissue wide morphogen gradient--and the evolutionary history--ancestral versus derived segmentation mode--strongly shaped both segmentation mechanisms. Furthermore, this implies that these patterning types are to be expected rather than random evolutionary outcomes and supports the likelihood of multiple parallel evolutionary origins.},

@article{Diaz2015,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: One of the most distinctive traits found within Chamaeleonidae is their split/cleft autopodia and the simplified and divergent morphology of the mesopodial skeleton. These anatomical characteristics have facilitated the adaptive radiation of chameleons to arboreal niches. To better understand the homology of chameleon carpal and tarsal elements, the process of syndactyly, cleft formation, and how modification of the mesopodial skeleton has played a role in the evolution and diversification of chameleons, we have studied the Veiled Chameleon (Chamaeleo calyptratus). We analysed limb patterning and morphogenesis through in situ hybridization, in vitro whole embryo culture and pharmacological perturbation, scoring for apoptosis, clefting, and skeletogenesis. Furthermore, we framed our data within a phylogenetic context by performing comparative skeletal analyses in 8 of the 12 currently recognized genera of extant chameleons.

RESULTS: Our study uncovered a previously underappreciated degree of mesopodial skeletal diversity in chameleons. Phylogenetically derived chameleons exhibit a 'typical' outgroup complement of mesopodial elements (with the exception of centralia), with twice the number of currently recognized carpal and tarsal elements considered for this clade. In contrast to avians and rodents, mesenchymal clefting in chameleons commences in spite of the maintenance of a robust apical ectodermal ridge (AER). Furthermore, Bmp signaling appears to be important for cleft initiation but not for maintenance of apoptosis. Interdigital cell death therefore may be an ancestral characteristic of the autopodium, however syndactyly is an evolutionary novelty. In addition, we find that the pisiform segments from the ulnare and that chameleons lack an astragalus-calcaneum complex typical of amniotes and have evolved an ankle architecture convergent with amphibians in phylogenetically higher chameleons.

CONCLUSION: Our data underscores the importance of comparative and phylogenetic approaches when studying development. Body size may have played a role in the characteristic mesopodial skeletal architecture of chameleons by constraining deployment of the skeletogenic program in the smaller and earliest diverged and basal taxa. Our study challenges the 're-evolution' of osteological features by showing that 're-evolving' a 'lost' feature de novo (contrary to Dollo's Law) may instead be due to so called 'missing structures' being present but underdeveloped and/or fused to other adjacent elements (cryptic features) whose independence may be re-established under changes in adaptive selective pressure.},

In 1851, the great biologist and philosopher published two landmark papers on pelagic tunicates in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society. They were dedicated to the description of the adult anatomy and life cycle of thaliaceans and appendicularians, the pelagic relatives of ascidians. In the first part of this review, we discuss the novel anatomical observations and evolutionary hypotheses made by Huxley, which would have a lasting influence on tunicate biology. We also briefly comment on the more philosophical reflections of Huxley on individuality. In the second part, we stress the originality and relevance of past and future studies of tunicates in the resolution of major biological issues. In particular, we focus on the complex relationship between genotype and phenotype and the phenomenon of developmental system drift. We propose that more than 150 years after Huxley's papers, tunicate embryos are still worth studying in their own right, independently of their evolutionary proximity to vertebrates, as they provide original and crucial insights into the process of animal evolution. Tunicates are still at the forefront of biological research.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The spatial distribution of many genes has been visualized during the embryonic development in the starlet sea anemone Nematostella vectensis in the last decade. In situ hybridization images are available in the Kahi Kai gene expression database, and a method has been developed to quantify spatial gene expression patterns of N. vectensis. In this paper, gene expression quantification is performed on a wide range of gene expression patterns from this database and descriptions of observed expression domains are stored in a separate database for further analysis.

METHODS: Spatial gene expression from suitable in situ hybridization images has been quantified with the GenExp program. A correlation analysis has been performed on the resulting numerical gene expression profiles for each stage. Based on the correlated clusters of spatial gene expression and detailed descriptions of gene expression domains, various mechanisms for developmental gene expression are proposed.

RESULTS: In the blastula and gastrula stages of development in N. vectensis, its continuous sheet of cells is partitioned into correlating gene expression domains. During progressing development, these regions likely correspond to different fates. A statistical analysis shows that genes generally remain expressed during the planula stages in those major regions that they occupy at the end of gastrulation.

DISCUSSION: Observed shifts in gene expression domain boundaries suggest that elongation in the planula stage mainly occurs in the vegetal ring under the influence of the gene Rx. The secondary body axis in N. vectensis is proposed to be determined at the mid blastula transition.

CONCLUSIONS: Early gene expression domains in N. vectensis appear to maintain a positional order along the primary body axis. Early determination in N. vectensis occurs in two stages: expression in broad circles and rings in the blastula is consolidated during gastrulation, and more complex expression patterns appear in the planula within these broad regions. Quantification and comparison of gene expression patterns across a database can generate hypotheses about collective cell movements before these movements are measured directly.},

abstract = {The modulation of developmental biochemical pathways by mechanical cues is an emerging feature of animal development, but its evolutionary origins have not been explored. Here we show that a common mechanosensitive pathway involving $\beta$-catenin specifies early mesodermal identity at gastrulation in zebrafish and Drosophila. Mechanical strains developed by zebrafish epiboly and Drosophila mesoderm invagination trigger the phosphorylation of $\beta$-catenin-tyrosine-667. This leads to the release of $\beta$-catenin into the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it triggers and maintains, respectively, the expression of zebrafish brachyury orthologue notail and of Drosophila Twist, both crucial transcription factors for early mesoderm identity. The role of the $\beta$-catenin mechanosensitive pathway in mesoderm identity has been conserved over the large evolutionary distance separating zebrafish and Drosophila. This suggests mesoderm mechanical induction dating back to at least the last bilaterian common ancestor more than 570 million years ago, the period during which mesoderm is thought to have emerged.},

abstract = {Little is known about broad patterns of variation and evolution of gene expression during any developmental process. Here we investigate variation in genome-wide gene expression among Drosophila simulans, Drosophila yakuba and four strains of Drosophila melanogaster during a major developmental transition--the start of metamorphosis. Differences in gene activity between these lineages follow a phylogenetic pattern, and 27{\%} of all of the genes in these genomes differ in their developmental gene expression between at least two strains or species. We identify, on a gene-by-gene basis, the evolutionary forces that shape this variation and show that, both within the transcriptional network that controls metamorphosis and across the whole genome, the expression changes of transcription factor genes are relatively stable, whereas those of their downstream targets are more likely to have evolved. Our results demonstrate extensive evolution of developmental gene expression among closely related species.},

@article{Artieri2010,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Speculation regarding the importance of changes in gene regulation in determining major phylogenetic patterns continues to accrue, despite a lack of broad-scale comparative studies examining how patterns of gene expression vary during development. Comparative transcriptional profiling of adult interspecific hybrids and their parental species has uncovered widespread divergence of the mechanisms controlling gene regulation, revealing incompatibilities that are masked in comparisons between the pure species. However, this has prompted the suggestion that misexpression in adult hybrids results from the downstream cascading effects of a subset of genes improperly regulated in early development.

RESULTS: We sought to determine how gene expression diverges over development, as well as test the cascade hypothesis, by profiling expression in males of Drosophila melanogaster, D. sechellia, and D. simulans, as well as the D. simulans (female) x D. sechellia (male) male F1 hybrids, at four different developmental time points (3rd instar larval, early pupal, late pupal, and newly-emerged adult). Contrary to the cascade model of misexpression, we find that there is considerable stage-specific autonomy of regulatory breakdown in hybrids, with the larval and adult stages showing significantly more hybrid misexpression as compared to the pupal stage. However, comparisons between pure species indicate that genes expressed during earlier stages of development tend to be more conserved in terms of their level of expression than those expressed during later stages, suggesting that while Von Baer's famous law applies at both the level of nucleotide sequence and expression, it may not apply necessarily to the underlying overall regulatory network, which appears to diverge over the course of ontogeny and which can only be ascertained by combining divergent genomes in species hybrids.

CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that complex integration of regulatory circuits during morphogenesis may lead to it being more refractory to divergence of underlying gene regulatory mechanisms--more than that suggested by the conservation of gene expression levels between species during earlier stages. This provides support for a 'developmental hourglass' model of divergence of gene expression in Drosophila resulting in a highly conserved pupal stage.},

abstract = {The study of mammalian evolution often relies on detailed analysis of dental morphology. For molecular patterning to play a role in dental evolution, gene expression differences should be linkable to corresponding morphological differences. Because teeth, like many other structures, are complex and evolution of new shapes usually involves subtle changes, we have developed topographic methods by using Geographic Information Systems. We investigated how genetic markers for epithelial signaling centers known as enamel knots are associated with evolutionary divergence of molar teeth in two rodent species, mouse and vole. Our analysis of expression patterns of Fgf4, Lef1, p21, and Shh genes in relation to digital elevation models of developing tooth shapes shows that molecular prepatterns predict the lateral cusp topography more than a day in advance. A heterotopic shift in the molecular prepatterns can be implicated in the evolution of mouse molar, changing locations from which historically homologous cusps form. The subtle but measurable heterotopic shifts may play a large role in the evolution of tooth cusp topographies. However, evolutionary increase in the number of longitudinal cusps in vole molar has involved accelerated longitudinal growth and iterative addition of new cusps without changes in lateral cusp topography. The iterative addition of cusps after the establishment of lateral cusp topography may limit the independence of individual morphological features used in evolutionary studies. The diversity of mammalian molar patterns may largely result from the heterotopic and iterative processes.},

abstract = {Co-option occurs when natural selection finds new uses for existing traits, including genes, organs, and other body structures. Genes can be co-opted to generate developmental and physiological novelties by changing their patterns of regulation, by changing the functions of the proteins they encode, or both. This often involves gene duplication followed by specialization of the resulting paralogous genes into particular functions. A major role for gene co-option in the evolution of development has long been assumed, and many recent comparative developmental and genomic studies have lent support to this idea. Although there is relatively less known about the molecular basis of co-option events involving developmental pathways, much can be drawn from well-studied examples of the co-option of structural proteins. Here, we summarize several case studies of both structural gene and developmental genetic circuit co-option and discuss how co-option may underlie major episodes of adaptive change in multicellular organisms. We also examine the phenomenon of intraspecific variability in gene expression patterns, which we propose to be one form of material for the co-option process. We integrate this information with recent models of gene family evolution to provide a framework for understanding the origin of co-optive evolution and the mechanisms by which natural selection promotes evolutionary novelty by inventing new uses for the genetic toolkit.},

Other, functionally specialized, genetic determinants, caller! regulator and operator genes, control the rate of protein synthesis through the intermediacy of cytoplas- mic components or repressors. The repressors can be either inactivated (induction) or activated (repression) by certain specific metabolites. This system of regulation appears to operate directly at the level of the synthesis by the gene of a short- lived intermediate, or messenger, which becomes associated with the ribosomes where protein synthesis takes place. 1.},

abstract = {The interpretation of morphogen gradients is a pivotal concept in developmental biology, and several mechanisms have been proposed to explain how gene regulatory networks (GRNs) achieve concentration-dependent responses. However, the number of different mechanisms that may exist for cells to interpret morphogens, and the importance of design features such as feedback or local cell-cell communication, is unclear. A complete understanding of such systems will require going beyond a case-by-case analysis of real morphogen interpretation mechanisms and mapping out a complete GRN 'design space.' Here, we generate a first atlas of design space for GRNs capable of patterning a homogeneous field of cells into discrete gene expression domains by interpreting a fixed morphogen gradient. We uncover multiple very distinct mechanisms distributed discretely across the atlas, thereby expanding the repertoire of morphogen interpretation network motifs. Analyzing this diverse collection of mechanisms also allows us to predict that local cell-cell communication will rarely be responsible for the basic dose-dependent response of morphogen interpretation networks.},

abstract = {How complex body plans evolved in animals such as fruit flies and vertebrates, as compared to the relatively simple jellyfish and sponges, is not known, given the similarity of developmental genetic repertoires shared by all these taxa. Here, we show that a core set of 18 microRNAs (miRNAs), non-coding RNA molecules that negatively regulate the expression of protein-coding genes, are found only in protostomes and deuterostomes and not in sponges or cnidarians. Because many of these miRNAs are expressed in specific tissues and/or organs, miRNA-mediated regulation could have played a fundamental evolutionary role in the origins of organs such as brain and heart--structures not found in cnidarians or sponges--and thus contributed greatly to the evolution of complex body plans. Furthermore, the continuous acquisition and fixation of miRNAs in various animal groups strongly correlates both with the hierarchy of metazoan relationships and with the non-random origination of metazoan morphological innovations through geologic time.},

It is concluded that estimates of the information content of both zygote and adult are highly arbitrary and of little value, and take no account of spatial organization. The suggestion that the amount of information increases during development arises only from an increase in the number of “units” that make up the embryo and thus the question as to how information content can increase is a pseudo-problem. It does not seem useful to try and compare the information content of the embryo at different stages of development or to consider development in terms of preformation and epigenesis. It is suggested that it may be more useful to consider the problem of how the apparently simple zygote gives rise to highly ordered complex structures, in terms of the egg containing instructions of a programme for development. Developmental instructions may be much simpler to specify than the end result. Emphasis is placed on the interaction between the parts of a developing system and that interactions can provide the increase in structural organization.},

For its first three billion years, life on Earth was a world of microscopic forms, rarely achieving a size greater than a millimetre or a complexity beyond two or three cell types. But in the past 600 million years, the evolution of much larger and more complex organisms has transformed the biosphere. Despite their disparate forms and physiologies, the evolution and diversification of plants, animals, fungi and other macroforms has followed similar global trends. One of the most important features underlying evolutionary increases in animal and plant size, complexity and diversity has been their modular construction from reiterated parts. Although simple filamentous and spherical forms may evolve wherever cellular life exists, the evolution of motile, modular mega-organisms might not be a universal pattern.},

The initial reference genome sequence reported more than a decade ago had a profound impact on progress in Drosophila research, and improving the accuracy and completeness of this sequence continues to be important to further progress. We previously described improvement of the 117-Mb sequence in the euchromatic portion of the genome and 21 Mb in the heterochromatic portion, using a whole-genome shotgun assembly, BAC physical mapping, and clone-based finishing. Here, we report an improved reference sequence of the single-copy and middle-repetitive regions of the genome, produced using cytogenetic mapping to mitotic and polytene chromosomes, clone-based finishing and BAC fingerprint verification, ordering of scaffolds by alignment to cDNA sequences, incorporation of other map and sequence data, and validation by whole-genome optical restriction mapping. These data substantially improve the accuracy and completeness of the reference sequence and the order and orientation of sequence scaffolds into chromosome arm assemblies. Representation of the Y chromosome and other heterochromatic regions is particularly improved. The new 143.9-Mb reference sequence, designated Release 6, effectively exhausts clone-based technologies for mapping and sequencing. Highly repeat-rich regions, including large satellite blocks and functional elements such as the ribosomal RNA genes and the centromeres, are largely inaccessible to current sequencing and assembly methods and remain poorly represented. Further significant improvements will require sequencing technologies that do not depend on molecular cloning and that produce very long reads.},

@article{DeRenzis2007,
abstract = {During the maternal-to-zygotic transition, a developing embryo integrates post-transcriptional regulation of maternal mRNAs with transcriptional activation of its own genome. By combining chromosomal ablation in Drosophila with microarray analysis, we characterized the basis of this integration. We show that the expression profile for at least one third of zygotically active genes is coupled to the concomitant degradation of the corresponding maternal mRNAs. The embryo uses transcription and degradation to generate localized patterns of expression, and zygotic transcription to degrade distinct classes of maternal transcripts. Although degradation does not appear to involve a simple regulatory code, the activation of the zygotic genome starts from intronless genes sharing a common cis-element. This cis-element interacts with a single protein, the Bicoid stability factor, and acts as a potent enhancer capable of timing the activity of an exogenous transactivator. We propose that this regulatory mode links morphogen gradients with temporal regulation during the maternal-to-zygotic transition.},

abstract = {The transition from maternal to zygotic control is fundamental to the life cycle of all multicellular organisms. It is widely believed that genomes are transcriptionally inactive from fertilization until zygotic genome activation (ZGA). Thus, the earliest genes expressed probably support the rapid cell divisions that precede morphogenesis and, if so, might be evolutionarily conserved. Here, we identify the earliest zygotic transcripts in the zebrafish, Danio rerio, through metabolic labeling and purification of RNA from staged embryos. Surprisingly, the mitochondrial genome was highly active from the one-cell stage onwards, showing that significant transcriptional activity exists at fertilization. We show that 592 nuclear genes become active when cell cycles are still only 15 min long, confining expression to relatively short genes. Furthermore, these zygotic genes are evolutionarily younger than those expressed at other developmental stages. Comparison of fish, fly, and mouse data revealed different sets of genes expressed at ZGA. This species specificity uncovers an evolutionary plasticity in early embryogenesis that probably confers substantial adaptive potential.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cellular metabolism is a fundamental biological system consisting of myriads of enzymatic reactions that together fulfill the basic requirements of life. The recent availability of vast amounts of sequence data from diverse sets of organisms provides an opportunity to systematically examine metabolism from a comparative perspective. Here we supplement existing genome and protein resources with partial genome datasets derived from 193 eukaryotes to present a comprehensive survey of the conservation of metabolism across 26 taxa representing the three domains of life.

RESULTS: In general, metabolic enzymes are highly conserved. However, organizing these enzymes within the context of functional pathways revealed a spectrum of conservation from those that are highly conserved (for example, carbohydrate, energy, amino acid and nucleotide metabolism enzymes) to those specific to individual taxa (for example, those involved in glycan metabolism and secondary metabolite pathways). Applying a novel co-conservation analysis, KEGG defined pathways did not generally display evolutionary coherence. Instead, such modularity appears restricted to smaller subsets of enzymes. Expanding analyses to a global metabolic network revealed a highly conserved, but nonetheless flexible, 'core' of enzymes largely involved in multiple reactions across different pathways. Enzymes and pathways associated with the periphery of this network were less well conserved and associated with taxon-specific innovations.

CONCLUSIONS: These findings point to an emerging picture in which a core of enzyme activities involving amino acid, energy, carbohydrate and lipid metabolism have evolved to provide the basic functions required for life. However, the precise complement of enzymes associated within this core for each species is flexible.},

By simulation of genes of equal age, we show that the inverse correlation between age and rate is an artifact caused by our inability to detect homology when evolutionary distances are large. Since evolutionary distance increases with time of divergence and rate of evolution, homologs of fast-evolving genes are frequently undetected in distantly related taxa and are, hence, misclassified as "new." This misclassification causes the mean genetic distance of 'new' genes to be overestimated and the mean genetic distance of "old" genes to be underestimated.},

abstract = {A large number of genes is shared by all living organisms, whereas many others are unique to some specific lineages, indicating their different times of origin. The availability of a growing number of eukaryotic genomes allows us to estimate which mammalian genes are novel genes and, approximately, when they arose. In this article, we classify human genes into four different age groups and estimate evolutionary rates in human and mouse orthologs. We show that older genes tend to evolve more slowly than newer ones; that is, proteins that arose earlier in evolution currently have a larger proportion of sites subjected to negative selection. Interestingly, this property is maintained when a fraction of the fastest-evolving genes is excluded or when only genes belonging to a given functional class are considered. One way to explain this relationship is by assuming that genes maintain their functional constraints along all their evolutionary history, but the nature of more recent evolutionary innovations is such that the functional constraints operating on them are increasingly weaker. Alternatively, our results would also be consistent with a scenario in which the functional constraints acting on a gene would not need to be constant through evolution. Instead, starting from weak functional constraints near the time of origin of a gene-as supported by mechanisms proposed for the origin of orphan genes-there would be a gradual increase in selective pressures with time, resulting in fewer accepted mutations in older versus more novel genes.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:New gene emergence is so far assumed to be mostly driven by duplication and divergence of existing genes. The possibility that entirely new genes could emerge out of the non-coding genomic background was long thought to be almost negligible. With the increasing availability of fully sequenced genomes across broad scales of phylogeny, it has become possible to systematically study the origin of new genes over time and thus revisit this question.RESULTS:We have used phylostratigraphy to assess trends of gene evolution across successive phylogenetic phases, using mostly the well-annotated mouse genome as a reference. We find several significant general trends and confirm them for three other vertebrate genomes (humans, zebrafish and stickleback). Younger genes are shorter, both with respect to gene length, as well as to open reading frame length. They contain also fewer exons and have fewer recognizable domains. Average exon length, on the other hand, does not change much over time. Only the most recently evolved genes have longer exons and they are often associated with active promotor regions, i.e. are part of bidirectional promotors. We have also revisited the possibility that de novo evolution of genes could occur even within existing genes, by making use of an alternative reading frame (overprinting). We find several cases among the annotated Ensembl ORFs, where the new reading frame has emerged at a higher phylostratigraphic level than the original one. We discuss some of these overprinted genes, which include also the Hoxa9 gene where an alternative reading frame covering the homeobox has emerged within the lineage leading to rodents and primates (Euarchontoglires).CONCLUSIONS:We suggest that the overall trends of gene emergence are more compatible with a de novo evolution model for orphan genes than a general duplication-divergence model. Hence de novo evolution of genes appears to have occurred continuously throughout evolutionary time and should therefore be considered as a general mechanism for the emergence of new gene functions.},

abstract = {Phylostratigraphy is a method for dating the evolutionary emergence of a gene or gene family by identifying its homologs across the tree of life, typically by using BLAST searches. Applying this method to all genes in a species, or genomic phylostratigraphy, allows investigation of genome-wide patterns in new gene origination at different evolutionary times and thus has been extensively used. However, gene age estimation depends on the challenging task of detecting distant homologs via sequence similarity, which is expected to have differential accuracies for different genes. Here, we evaluate the accuracy of phylostratigraphy by realistic computer simulation with parameters estimated from genomic data, and investigate the impact of its error on findings of genome evolution. We show that 1) phylostratigraphy substantially underestimates gene age for a considerable fraction of genes, 2) the error is especially serious when the protein evolves rapidly, is short, and/or its most conserved block of sites is small, and 3) these errors create spurious nonuniform distributions of various gene properties among age groups, many of which cannot be predicted a priori. Given the high likelihood that conclusions about gene age are faulty, we advocate the use of realistic simulation to determine if observations from phylostratigraphy are explainable, at least qualitatively, by a null model of biased measurement, and in all cases, critical evaluation of results.},

abstract = {Directional selection is a major force driving adaptation and evolutionary change. However, the distribution, strength, and tempo of phenotypic selection acting on quantitative traits in natural populations remain unclear across different study systems. We reviewed the literature (1984-1997) that reported the strength of directional selection as indexed by standardized linear selection gradients (beta). We asked how strong are viability and sexual selection, and whether strength of selection is correlated with the time scale over which it was measured. Estimates of the magnitude of directional selection (absolute value of beta) were exponentially distributed, with few estimates greater than 0.50 and most estimates less than 0.15. Sexual selection (measured by mating success) appeared stronger than viability selection (measured by survival). Viability selection that was measured over short periods (days) was typically stronger than selection measured over longer periods (months and years), but the strength of sexual selection did not vary with duration of selection episodes; as a result, sexual selection was stronger than viability selection over longer time scales (months and years), but not over short time scales (days).},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Genes are often characterized dichotomously as either housekeeping or single-tissue specific. We conjectured that crucial functional information resides in genes with midrange profiles of expression.

RESULTS: To obtain such novel information genome-wide, we have determined the mRNA expression levels for one of the largest hitherto analyzed set of 62 839 probesets in 12 representative normal human tissues. Indeed, when using a newly defined graded tissue specificity index tau, valued between 0 for housekeeping genes and 1 for tissue-specific genes, genes with midrange profiles having 0.15{\textless} tau{\textless}0.85 were found to constitute {\textgreater}50{\%} of all expression patterns. We developed a binary classification, indicating for every gene the I(B) tissues in which it is overly expressed, and the 12-I(B) tissues in which it shows low expression. The 85 dominant midrange patterns with I(B)=2-11 were found to be bimodally distributed, and to contribute most significantly to the definition of tissue specification dendrograms. Our analyses provide a novel route to infer expression profiles for presumed ancestral nodes in the tissue dendrogram. Such definition has uncovered an unsuspected correlation, whereby de novo enhancement and diminution of gene expression go hand in hand. These findings highlight the importance of gene suppression events, with implications to the course of tissue specification in ontogeny and phylogeny.

For calculating expression levels from RNA-Seq coverage data, the
uniquely transcribed region(s) for each localized gene was determined
by taking regions covered by exons of the gene and excluding
transcribed regions from any overlapping genes, both with respect to
genes lying on same strand (for calculation using strand-specific
RNA-Seq coverage data), and for genes on either strand (for
calculation using unstranded RNA-Seq coverage data). RNA-Seq coverage
read-count data was then correlated by location with the uniquely
transcribed region(s) of each gene to produce the sum of reads over
the entire uniquely transcribed region for the gene. Reads per
kilobase of exon model per million mapped reads (RPKM) was then
calculated using the method from Motazavi et al, Nat. Methods 6,
621-628 (2008). (RPKM = 10{\^{}}9 * C / N * L * R, where C = number of
reads in gene, N = number of uniquely mappable reads in the
experiment, L = sum of uniquely transcribed bases in bp, and R = read
length in bp.) The RPKM values were further binned into eight
expression level bins (by RPKM value) to improve querying
capabilities and displays. RPKM levels and expression level bins are
recalculated for a gene whenever modifications are introducted to one
or more transcripts in its genomic region. For calculating expression
levels from the FlyAtlas larval and adult tissue data, FlyAtlas
provided mean coverage levels for Affy2 probe sets, and FlyBase
intersected these probe sets with the exons of all FlyBase genes
(using D. melanogaster Annotation Release 5.26) to associate each
probe set with one or more FlyBase genes. These values were
distributed into five expression level bins for further analysis.

abstract = {The possible association between gonadal protein divergence and postzygotic reproductive isolation was investigated among species of the Drosophila melanogaster and D. virilis groups. Protein divergence was scored by high-resolution two-dimensional electrophoresis (2DE). Close to 500 protein spots from gonadal tissues (testis and ovary) and nongonadal tissues (malpighian tubules and brain) were analyzed and protein divergence was calculated based on presence vs absence. Both testis and ovary proteins showed higher divergence than nongonadal proteins, and also a highly significant positive correlation with postzygotic reproductive isolation but a weaker correlation with postzygotic reproductive isolation. Particularly, a positive and significant correlation was found between proteins expressed in the testis and postzygotic reproductive isolation among closely related species such as the within-phylad species in the D. virilis group. The high levels of male-reproductive-tract protein divergence between species might be associated with F1 hybrid male sterility among closely related species. If so, a lower level of ovary protein divergence should be expected on the basis that F1 female hybrids are fully fertile. However, this is not necessarily true if relatively few genes are responsible for the reproductive isolation observed between closely related species, as recent studies seem to suggest. We suggest that the faster rate of evolution of gonadal proteins in comparison to nongonadal proteins and the association of that rate with postzygotic reproductive isolation may be the result of episodic and/or sexual selection on male and female molecular traits.},

abstract = {We investigate the extent by which the estimates of the rate of adaptive molecular evolution obtained by extending the McDonald-Kreitman test are biased if the species, subjected to analysis, diverged recently. We show that estimates can be biased if the nucleotide divergence between the species is low relative to within species variation, and that the magnitude of the bias depends on the rate of adaptive evolution and the distribution of fitness effects of new mutations. Bias appears to be because of three factors: (1) misattribution of polymorphism to divergence; (2) the contribution of ancestral polymorphism to divergence; and (3) different rates of fixation of neutral and advantageous mutations. If there is little adaptive molecular evolution, then slightly deleterious mutations inflate estimates of the rate of adaptive evolution, because these contribute proportionately more to polymorphism than to nucleotide divergence than neutral mutations. However, if there is substantial adaptive evolution, polymorphism contributing to apparent divergence may downwardly bias estimates. We propose a simple method for correcting the different contributions of slightly deleterious and neutral mutations to polymorphism and divergence, and apply it to datasets from several species. We find that estimates of the rate of adaptive molecular evolution from closely related species may be underestimates by {\~{}}10{\%} or more. However, after the contribution of polymorphism to divergence is removed, the rate of adaptive evolution may still be overestimated as a consequence of ancestral polymorphism and time for fixation effects. This bias may be substantial if branch lengths are less than 10N (e) generations.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: High-throughput sequencing technologies, such as the Illumina Genome Analyzer, are powerful new tools for investigating a wide range of biological and medical questions. Statistical and computational methods are key for drawing meaningful and accurate conclusions from the massive and complex datasets generated by the sequencers. We provide a detailed evaluation of statistical methods for normalization and differential expression (DE) analysis of Illumina transcriptome sequencing (mRNA-Seq) data.

RESULTS: We compare statistical methods for detecting genes that are significantly DE between two types of biological samples and find that there are substantial differences in how the test statistics handle low-count genes. We evaluate how DE results are affected by features of the sequencing platform, such as, varying gene lengths, base-calling calibration method (with and without phi X control lane), and flow-cell/library preparation effects. We investigate the impact of the read count normalization method on DE results and show that the standard approach of scaling by total lane counts (e.g., RPKM) can bias estimates of DE. We propose more general quantile-based normalization procedures and demonstrate an improvement in DE detection.

CONCLUSIONS: Our results have significant practical and methodological implications for the design and analysis of mRNA-Seq experiments. They highlight the importance of appropriate statistical methods for normalization and DE inference, to account for features of the sequencing platform that could impact the accuracy of results. They also reveal the need for further research in the development of statistical and computational methods for mRNA-Seq.},

Here, we have used the newly released genome sequences from 12 Drosophila species, coupled to a larger set of SRR genes, to comprehensively test the generality of these patterns. Among 2505 SRR genes examined, including ESTs with biased expression in reproductive tissues and genes characterized as involved in gametogenesis, we find that a relatively high proportion of SRR genes have experienced accelerated divergence throughout the genus Drosophila. Several testis-specific genes, male seminal fluid proteins (SFPs), and spermatogenesis genes show lineage-specific bursts of accelerated evolution and positive selection. SFP genes also show evidence of lineage-specific gene loss and/or gain. These results bring us closer to understanding the details of the evolutionary dynamics of SRR genes with respect to species divergence.},

Non-coding sequences are known to contain functionally important elements controlling gene expression, but the proportion of sites that are selectively constrained is still largely unknown. We have compared the complete D. melanogaster and Drosophila simulans genome sequences to estimate mean selective constraint (the fraction of mutations that are eliminated by selection) in coding and non-coding DNA by standardizing to substitution rates in putatively unconstrained sequences. We show that constraint is positively correlated with intronic and intergenic sequence length and is generally remarkably strong in non-coding DNA, implying that more than half of all point mutations in the Drosophila genome are deleterious. This fraction is also likely to be an underestimate if many substitutions in non-coding DNA are adaptively driven to fixation. We also show that substitutions in long introns and intergenic sequences are clustered, such that there is an excess of substitutions {\textless}8 bp apart and a deficit farther apart. These results suggest that there are blocks of constrained nucleotides, presumably involved in gene expression control, that are concentrated in long non-coding sequences. Furthermore, we infer that there is more than three times as much functional non-coding DNA as protein-coding DNA in the Drosophila genome. Most deleterious mutations therefore occur in non-coding DNA, and these may make an important contribution to a wide variety of evolutionary processes.},

Although the major pathways in turnover have been identified, accounting for disparate half-lives has been elusive. We show that codon optimality is one feature that contributes greatly to mRNA stability. Genome-wide RNA decay analysis revealed that stable mRNAs are enriched in codons designated optimal, whereas unstable mRNAs contain predominately non-optimal codons. Substitution of optimal codons with synonymous, non-optimal codons results in dramatic mRNA destabilization, whereas the converse substitution significantly increases stability. Further, we demonstrate that codon optimality impacts ribosome translocation, connecting the processes of translation elongation and decay through codon optimality. Finally, we show that optimal codon content accounts for the similar stabilities observed in mRNAs encoding proteins with coordinated physiological function. This work demonstrates that codon optimization exists as a mechanism to finely tune levels of mRNAs and, ultimately, proteins.},

abstract = {Sequence divergence scaled by variation within species has been used to infer the action of selection upon individual genes. Applying this approach to expression, we compared whole-genome whole-body RNA levels in 10 heterozygous Drosophila simulans genotypes and a pooled sample of 10 D. melanogaster lines using Affymetrix Genechip. For 972 genes expressed in D. melanogaster, the transcript level was below detection threshold in D. simulans, which may be explained either by sequence divergence between the primers on the chip and the mRNA transcripts or by down-regulation of these genes. Out of 6,707 genes that were expressed in both species, transcript level was significantly different between species for 534 genes (at P {\textless} 0.001). Genes whose expression is under stabilizing selection should exhibit reduced genetic variation within species and reduced divergence between species. Expression of genes under directional selection in D. simulans should be highly divergent from D. melanogaster, while showing low genetic variation in D. simulans. Finally, the genes with large variation within species but modest divergence between species are candidates for balancing selection. Rapidly diverging, low-polymorphism genes included those involved in reproduction (e.g., Mst 3Ba, 98Cb; Acps 26Aa, 63F; and sperm-specific dynein). Genes with high variation in transcript abundance within species included metallothionein and hairless, both hypothesized to be segregating in nature because of gene-by-environment interactions. Further, we compared expression divergence and DNA substitution rate in 195 genes. Synonymous substitution rate and expression divergences were uncorrelated, whereas there was a significant positive correlation between nonsynonymous substitution rate and expression divergence. We hypothesize that as a substantial fraction of nonsynonymous divergence has been shown to be adaptive, much of the observed expression divergence is likewise adaptive.},

abstract = {Many genes in higher eukaryotes show sexually dimorphic expression, and these genes tend to be among the most divergent between species. In most cases, however, it is not known whether this rapid divergence is caused by positive selection or if it is due to a relaxation of selective constraint. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we surveyed DNA sequence polymorphism in 91 Drosophila melanogaster genes with male-, female-, or nonsex-biased expression and determined their divergence from the sister species D. simulans. Using several single- and multilocus statistical tests, we estimated the type and strength of selection influencing the evolution of the proteins encoded by genes of each expression class. Adaptive evolution, as indicated by a relative excess of nonsynonymous divergence between species, was common among the sex-biased genes (both male and female). Male-biased genes, in particular, showed a strong and consistent signal of positive selection, while female-biased genes showed more variation in the type of selection they experience. Genes expressed equally in the two sexes, in contrast, showed no evidence for adaptive evolution between D. melanogaster and D. simulans. This suggests that sexual selection and intersexual coevolution are the major forces driving genetic differentiation between species.},

abstract = {The Drosophila melanogaster Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP) is a community resource of 205 sequenced inbred lines, derived to improve our understanding of the effects of naturally occurring genetic variation on molecular and organismal phenotypes. We used an integrated genotyping strategy to identify 4,853,802 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 1,296,080 non-SNP variants. Our molecular population genomic analyses show higher deletion than insertion mutation rates and stronger purifying selection on deletions. Weaker selection on insertions than deletions is consistent with our observed distribution of genome size determined by flow cytometry, which is skewed toward larger genomes. Insertion/deletion and single nucleotide polymorphisms are positively correlated with each other and with local recombination, suggesting that their nonrandom distributions are due to hitchhiking and background selection. Our cytogenetic analysis identified 16 polymorphic inversions in the DGRP. Common inverted and standard karyotypes are genetically divergent and account for most of the variation in relatedness among the DGRP lines. Intriguingly, variation in genome size and many quantitative traits are significantly associated with inversions. Approximately 50{\%} of the DGRP lines are infected with Wolbachia, and four lines have germline insertions of Wolbachia sequences, but effects of Wolbachia infection on quantitative traits are rarely significant. The DGRP complements ongoing efforts to functionally annotate the Drosophila genome. Indeed, 15{\%} of all D. melanogaster genes segregate for potentially damaged proteins in the DGRP, and genome-wide analyses of quantitative traits identify novel candidate genes. The DGRP lines, sequence data, genotypes, quality scores, phenotypes, and analysis and visualization tools are publicly available.},

Since the fitness cost of a translational misincorporation will depend on how the amino acid substitution affects protein function, selection for translational accuracy predicts an association between codon usage in DNA and functional constraint at the protein level. The frequency of preferred codons is significantly higher at codons conserved for amino acids than at nonconserved codons in 38 genes compared between D. melanogaster and Drosophila virilis or Drosophila pseudoobscura (Z = 5.93, P {\textless} 10(-6)). Preferred codon usage is also significantly higher in putative zinc-finger and homeodomain regions than in the rest of 28 D. melanogaster transcription factor encoding genes (Z = 8.38, P {\textless} 10(-6)). Mutational alternatives (within-gene differences in mutation rates, amino acid changes altering codon preference states, and doublet mutations at adjacent bases) do not appear to explain this association between synonymous codon usage and amino acid constraint.},

abstract = {In a wide variety of organisms, synonymous codons are used with different frequencies, a phenomenon known as codon bias. Population genetic studies have shown that synonymous sites are under weak selection and that codon bias is maintained by a balance between selection, mutation, and genetic drift. It appears that the major cause for selection on codon bias is that certain preferred codons are translated more accurately and/or efficiently. However, additional and sometimes maybe even contradictory selective forces appear to affect codon usage as well. In this review, we discuss the current understanding of the ways in which natural selection participates in the creation and maintenance of codon bias. We also raise several open questions: (i) Is natural selection weak independently of the level of codon bias? It is possible that selection for preferred codons is weak only when codon bias approaches equilibrium and may be quite strong on genes with codon bias levels that are much lower and/or above equilibrium. (ii) What determines the identity of the major codons? (iii) How do shifts in codon bias occur? (iv) What is the exact nature of selection on codon bias? We discuss these questions in depth and offer some ideas on how they can be addressed using a combination of computational and experimental analyses.},

The degree of divergence varies greatly among genes at both synonymous (silent) and nonsynonymous sites. Much of the variation in silent substitution rates can be explained by natural selection on synonymous codon usage, varying in intensity with gene expression level. Silent substitution rates also vary significantly with chromosomal location, with genes near oriC having lower divergence. Certain genes have been examined in more detail. In particular, the duplicate genes encoding elongation factor Tu, tufA and tufB, from S. typhimurium have been compared to their E. coli homologues. As expected these very highly expressed genes have high codon usage bias and have diverged very little between the two species. Interestingly, these genes, which are widely spaced on the bacterial chromosome, also appear to be undergoing concerted evolution, i.e., there has been exchange between the loci subsequent to the divergence of the two species.},

abstract = {The joint consequences of inbreeding, natural selection, and deleterious mutation on mean fitness after population shrinkage are of great importance in evolution and can be critical to the conservation of endangered populations. I present simple analytical equations that predict these consequences, improving and extending a previous heuristic treatment. Purge is defined as the "extra" selection induced by inbreeding, due to the "extra" fitness disadvantage (2d) of homozygotes for (partially) recessive deleterious alleles. Its effect is accounted for by using, instead of the classical inbreeding coefficient f, a purged inbreeding coefficient g that is weighed by the reduction of the frequency of deleterious alleles caused by purging. When the effective size of a large population is reduced to a smaller stable value N (with Nd ≥ 1), the purged inbreeding coefficient after t generations can be predicted as g(t) ≈ [(1 - 1/2N) g(t)(-1) + 1/2N](1 - 2d f(t)(-1)), showing how purging acts upon previously accumulated inbreeding and how its efficiency increases with N. This implies an early fitness decay, followed by some recovery. During this process, the inbreeding depression rate shifts from its ancestral value ($\delta$) to that of the mutation-selection-drift balance corresponding to N ($\delta$*), and standard selection cancels out the inbreeding depression ascribed to $\delta$*. Therefore, purge and inbreeding operate only upon the remaining $\delta$ - $\delta$*. The method is applied to the conservation strategy in which family contributions to the breeding pool are equal and is extended to make use of genealogical information. All these predictions are checked using computer simulation.},

A plot of the times of origin of body plans against their cell type numbers suggests that the upper bound of complexity has increased more or less steadily from the earliest metazoans until today, at an average rate of about one cell type per 3 m.y. (when nerve cell types are lumped). Computer models in which increase or decrease in cell type number was random were used to investigate the behavior of the upper bound of cell type number in evolving clades. The models are Markovian; variance in cell type number increases linearly through time. Scaled to the fossil record of the upper bound of cell type numbers, the models suggest that early rates of increase in maximum complexity were relatively high. The models and the data are mutually consistent and suggest that the Metazoa originated near 600 Ma, that the metazoan "explosion" near the Precambrian/Cambrian transition was not associated with any important increase in complexity of body plans, and that important decreases in the upper bound of complexity are unlikely to have occurred.},

The effect of random deleterious mutations was well described by a log-normal distribution, with -19{\%} reduction of average fitness; the effects distribution of preobserved deleterious mutations was better explained by a beta model. The fit of both models was improved when combined with a uniform distribution. Up to 40{\%} of random mutations were lethal. The proportion of beneficial mutations was unexpectedly high.

We show that many limb enhancers are retained in snake genomes, suggesting that these elements may function in non-limb tissues. Consistent with this, our analysis of cis-regulatory activity in mice and Anolis lizards reveals that patterns of enhancer activity in embryonic limbs and genitalia overlap heavily. In mice, deletion of HLEB, an enhancer of Tbx4, produces defects in hindlimbs and genitalia, establishing the importance of this limb-genital enhancer for development of these different appendages. Further analyses demonstrate that the HLEB of snakes has lost hindlimb enhancer function while retaining genital activity. Our findings identify roles for Tbx4 in genital development and highlight deep similarities in cis-regulatory activity between limbs and genitalia.},

abstract = {DNA sequencing has revealed high levels of variability within most species. Statistical methods based on population genetics theory have been applied to the resulting data and suggest that most mutations affecting functionally important sequences are deleterious but subject to very weak selection. Quantitative genetic studies have provided information on the extent of genetic variation within populations in traits related to fitness and the rate at which variability in these traits arises by mutation. This paper attempts to combine the available information from applications of the two approaches to populations of the fruitfly Drosophila in order to estimate some important parameters of genetic variation, using a simple population genetics model of mutational effects on fitness components. Analyses based on this model suggest the existence of a class of mutations with much larger fitness effects than those inferred from sequence variability and that contribute most of the standing variation in fitness within a population caused by the input of mildly deleterious mutations. However, deleterious mutations explain only part of this standing variation, and other processes such as balancing selection appear to make a large contribution to genetic variation in fitness components in Drosophila.},

abstract = {Several contributing factors have been implicated in evolutionary rate heterogeneity among proteins, but their evolutionary mechanisms remain poorly characterized. The recently sequenced 12 Drosophila genomes provide a unique opportunity to shed light on these unresolved issues. Here, we focus on the role of natural selection in shaping evolutionary rates. We use the Drosophila genomic data to distinguish between factors that increase the strength of purifying selection on proteins and factors that affect the amount of positive selection experienced by proteins. We confirm the importance of translational selection in shaping protein evolution in Drosophila and show that factors such as tissue bias in expression, gene essentiality, intron number, and recombination rate also contribute to evolutionary rate variation among proteins.},

abstract = {Recombination is a fundamental biological process with profound evolutionary implications. Theory predicts that recombination increases the effectiveness of selection in natural populations. Yet, direct tests of this prediction have been restricted to qualitative trends due to the lack of detailed characterization of recombination rate variation across genomes and within species. The use of imprecise recombination rates can also skew population genetic analyses designed to assess the presence and mode of selection across genomes. Here we report the first integrated high-resolution description of genomic and population variation in recombination, which also distinguishes between the two outcomes of meiotic recombination: crossing over (CO) and gene conversion (GC). We characterized the products of 5,860 female meioses in Drosophila melanogaster by genotyping a total of 139 million informative SNPs and mapped 106,964 recombination events at a resolution down to 2 kilobases. This approach allowed us to generate whole-genome CO and GC maps as well as a detailed description of variation in recombination among individuals of this species. We describe many levels of variation in recombination rates. At a large-scale (100 kb), CO rates exhibit extreme and highly punctuated variation along chromosomes, with hot and coldspots. We also show extensive intra-specific variation in CO landscapes that is associated with hotspots at low frequency in our sample. GC rates are more uniformly distributed across the genome than CO rates and detectable in regions with reduced or absent CO. At a local scale, recombination events are associated with numerous sequence motifs and tend to occur within transcript regions, thus suggesting that chromatin accessibility favors double-strand breaks. All these non-independent layers of variation in recombination across genomes and among individuals need to be taken into account in order to obtain relevant estimates of recombination rates, and should be included in a new generation of population genetic models of the interaction between selection and linkage.},

The genomes of 12 Drosophila species, ten of which are presented here for the first time (sechellia, simulans, yakuba, erecta, ananassae, persimilis, willistoni, mojavensis, virilis and grimshawi), illustrate how rates and patterns of sequence divergence across taxa can illuminate evolutionary processes on a genomic scale. These genome sequences augment the formidable genetic tools that have made Drosophila melanogaster a pre-eminent model for animal genetics, and will further catalyse fundamental research on mechanisms of development, cell biology, genetics, disease, neurobiology, behaviour, physiology and evolution. Despite remarkable similarities among these Drosophila species, we identified many putatively non-neutral changes in protein-coding genes, non-coding RNA genes, and cis-regulatory regions. These may prove to underlie differences in the ecology and behaviour of these diverse species.},

abstract = {The distribution of fitness effects of new mutations (DFE) is important for addressing several questions in genetics, including the nature of quantitative variation and the evolutionary fate of small populations. Properties of the DFE can be inferred by comparing the distributions of the frequencies of segregating nucleotide polymorphisms at selected and neutral sites in a population sample, but demographic changes alter the spectrum of allele frequencies at both neutral and selected sites, so can bias estimates of the DFE if not accounted for. We have developed a maximum-likelihood approach, based on the expected allele-frequency distribution generated by transition matrix methods, to estimate parameters of the DFE while simultaneously estimating parameters of a demographic model that allows a population size change at some time in the past. We tested the method using simulations and found that it accurately recovers simulated parameter values, even if the simulated demography differs substantially from that assumed in our analysis. We use our method to estimate parameters of the DFE for amino acid-changing mutations in humans and Drosophila melanogaster. For a model of unconditionally deleterious mutations, with effects sampled from a gamma distribution, the mean estimate for the distribution shape parameter is approximately 0.2 for human populations, which implies that the DFE is strongly leptokurtic. For Drosophila populations, we estimate that the shape parameter is approximately 0.35. Differences in the shape of the distribution and the mean selection coefficient between humans and Drosophila result in significantly more strongly deleterious mutations in Drosophila than in humans, and, conversely, nearly neutral mutations are significantly less frequent.},

The method is fairly robust to changes in population size and admixture, and it can be corrected for any residual effects if a model of the demography is available. We apply the method to extensively sampled single-nucleotide polymorphism data from humans and estimate the distribution of fitness effects for amino acid changing mutations. We show that a gamma distribution with a shape parameter of 0.23 provides a good fit to the data and we estimate that {\textgreater}50{\%} of mutations are likely to have mild effects, such that they reduce fitness by between one one-thousandth and one-tenth. We also infer that {\textless}15{\%} of new mutations are likely to have strongly deleterious effects. We estimate that on average a nonsynonymous mutation reduces fitness by a few percent and that the average strength of selection acting against a nonsynonymous polymorphism is approximately 9 x 10(-5). We argue that the relaxation of natural selection due to modern medicine and reduced variance in family size is not likely to lead to a rapid decline in genetic quality, but that it will be very difficult to locate most of the genes involved in complex genetic diseases.},
annote = {They propose a method to estimate the DFE from data of SNPs in humans (90 ind, 320 genes).
---------
BASIS:
They use the observed SFS to estimate the DFE
They get a DFE after fitting several parameters of the DFE model to the observed data, using a MCMC. 

This MCMC is made to get an estimate that fit the data by a random walk from a initial parameter value, each "step" is accepted of rejected based on the probability the new parameter value has. After millions of iterations, the parameters should be close to the real parameter value.

In their estimations, MCMC was run for a burn in of 1,000,000 steps before being sampled for a further 50,000,000 steps.
----------
THE METHOD:

The number of non-synonymous SNPs expected to found at a certain frequency depends on:
-the effective population size (Nes)
-mutation rate of that frequency category(ur)
-the [observed] number of non-synonymous mutations (Ln)
-time that a new deleterious mutation of strength spend between x and x+dx (H)
-probability of observing a mutation at a freq x in the population. (given the total number of alleles, is based on permutations)

The number of intron SNPs expected to found at a certain frequency depends on:
-the effective population size (Nes)
-mutation rate of that frequency category(ur)
-the [observed] number of intron mutations (Li)

Genes can have their own Ne and u, but they all share the same DFE.

----------
DEMOGRAPHY:

They run simulations to see how well this method behaves in different demographic scenarios. They try 3 different models:
-Population expansion
-Admixture (population divides in 2, evolve independently, then merge again)
-bottle neck
-----------
ACCOUNTING FOR DEMOGRAPHY

They realize that their estimated mean strength of selection might be overestimated by the demography, they try to correct it by:
1)Estimate the parameters of the DFE (gamma0 and lambda0) 
2)Estimate the demographic model using the neutral data.
3)Simulate data under the demographic model using the shape parameters in 1) and reestimate the parameters of the DFE (gamma1 and lambda1). Then correct the estimates by eq 7 and iterate this until lamba0 and lamba1 is equal.

After a couple of iterations, they get arameter values very close to the "real" ones (estimated from the EGP data )

---------
MEASURING THE MEAN STRENGTH OF SELECTION:

the selection acting upon segregating polymorphisms (by randomly sampled non-synonymous polymorphism) can be estimated more accurately since this is the part of the distribution for which we have direct information.


----------
ASSUMPTIONS:

- All selected mutations are deleterious, but selection can be so weak that they are effectively neutral
-method requires that there are two types of sites : a set of sites at which all mutations are neutral and sites at which some of themutations are subject to selection. We assume here that mutations in introns are neutral and estimate the distribution of fitness effects for mutations that change an amino acid.
-Free recombinations between sites
-Demography affects all loci in a simmilar way.
-They assume the deviations of the intron distribution from a truly neutral one is due to expansion and/or admixture

------------------------
RESULTS:

Estimated DFE from the site freq spectrum of both non-synonymous and intron sites is:
shape parameter = 0.23 with 95{\%} credibility intervals of 0.19–0.27 and the mean of (strength of selection) the distribution to be 425 (225, 766)
-the vast majority of amino-acid-changing mutations in humans have mild effects of between 1/1000 and 1/10.

------------------------
LIMITATIONS:

There are limitations for estimating the DFE for strongly selected mutations, as to be able to see them segragating in a population you would need a huge sample size.},

Initial estimates in Drosophila suggest that approximately 50{\%} of all amino acid substitutions, and a substantial fraction of substitutions in non-coding DNA, have been fixed as a consequence of adaptive evolution.

It has been studied by two different approaches: mutation accumulation and mutagenesis experiments, and the analysis of DNA sequence data. The proportion of mutations that are advantageous, effectively neutral and deleterious varies between species, and the DFE differs between coding and non-coding DNA. Despite these differences between species and genomic regions, some general principles have emerged: advantageous mutations are rare, and those that are strongly selected are exponentially distributed; and the DFE of deleterious mutations is complex and multi-modal.},
annote = {Review on the DFE (Distribution fitness effects).

DFE
relative frequencies of the continuum of selective 
effects of mutations.

-the most direct method to investigate the DFE is either to induce or to collect spontaneous mutations and assay their effects (fitness) in the laboratory. This is difficult and time consuming.

-------------------
-An alternative is to infer the neutralm deleterious and advantageous characteristics of the DFE by examining DNA polymorphism and divergence data.

- these methods rely mainly on two assumptions:
1)the probability that a mutation spreads to a certain freq in a population (or to fixation) depends on the strength of selection (positive or negative) acting on it. Severly deleterious mutations have lower probability to reach a high frequency in a population.
2) the efficiency of selection depends on the effective population size. With a high effective polulation size, selection is more efficient and a smaller proportion of mutation will behave as effectively neutral.

The "absolute strength" of selection on a mutation is then measured as NeS, the product of the effective population size by the selective coefficient of the mutation. Mutations with NeS much less than 1 are effectively neutral, while NeS greater than 100 have no chance to appear as polymorphism.

"By considering the number of substitutions that have occurred between species at (ds ) sites, it is possible to estimate the proportion of non-silent non-silent mutations that are effectively neutral (BOX 2)."
Such analysis suggest that for the Drosophila species, 16{\%} of mutations (in amino-acid sequences) are effectively neutral (ref44).

ADVANTAGEOUS MUTATIONS
In protein coding sequences, the proportion of adaptive non-synonimous susbstitutions has been estimated to be about 50{\%} between Drosophila species (ref 61-63, but 64). Also, it is estimated for Drosophila that around 15{\%} of non-coding substitutions are adaptive driven (ref49)

DELETERIOUS MUTATIONS
The DFE for deleterious mutations may be complex, with multimodal distribution (many mutations with a letal or almost neutral effect). This might be caused by the inherently different effects of several classes of sites and mutations:
differences between coding and no-coding DNA, point mutations vs transposable elements.

The DFE os amino-acid changing mutations is strongly leptokurtic: i.e., gamma distribution with a shape parameter {\textless}{\textless} 1.

---------------------
DFE FROM DNA SEQUENCE

Good example the estimates for human non-synonymous DFE, because of the vast amount of information (230 genes and 180 alleles sampled).
Few amino-acid mutations have effects greater than 10{\%}.

------------------
CONCLUSSIONS:

-DFE varies between species.
-DFE is exponential foe strongly advantageous mutations
-DFE for deleterious is complex and variable between species-
-DFE in non-synonymous mutation is leptokurtic with many more weakly selected mutations (than non-coding mutations)

-For multicellular organims, as opposite to unicellular ones, most mutations, even if they are deleterious, have so small effects that their fitness consequences are imposible to estimate.
-This might be overcome by DNA sequence analysis. by examining the polymorphism in a species (so the weakly deleterious mutations can be estimated).},

abstract = {Population genomic studies have shown that genetic draft and background selection can profoundly affect the genome-wide patterns of molecular variation. We performed forward simulations under realistic gene-structure and selection scenarios to investigate whether such linkage effects impinge on the ability of the McDonald-Kreitman (MK) test to infer the rate of positive selection ($\alpha$) from polymorphism and divergence data. We find that in the presence of slightly deleterious mutations, MK estimates of $\alpha$ severely underestimate the true rate of adaptation even if all polymorphisms with population frequencies under 50{\%} are excluded. Furthermore, already under intermediate rates of adaptation, genetic draft substantially distorts the site frequency spectra at neutral and functional sites from the expectations under mutation-selection-drift balance. MK-type approaches that first infer demography from synonymous sites and then use the inferred demography to correct the estimation of $\alpha$ obtain almost the correct $\alpha$ in our simulations. However, these approaches typically infer a severe past population expansion although there was no such expansion in the simulations, casting doubt on the accuracy of methods that infer demography from synonymous polymorphism data. We propose a simple asymptotic extension of the MK test that yields accurate estimates of $\alpha$ in our simulations and should provide a fruitful direction for future studies.},
annote = {The authors make molecular evolution simulations, to test if the estimates of the widely used MK-test are accurate in the presence of genetic draft and background selection.

Genetic draft:
stochastic effects generated by recurrent selective sweeps at closely linked sites.

Background selection
interference among linked sites caused by lightly deleterious polymorphisms 

"genetic draft and background selection can reduce the levels of polymorphism at linked neutral sites"..

--------------------------
They find that in the presence of slightly deleterous mutations, MK estimates are severly underestimated.

They also show that making a cutoff of the polymorphisms considered (based on their frequency), reduced the bias but the alpha is still underestimated.

They found the "sophisticated method" DFE alpha is very accurate to calculate alpha when changes is demography are considered. The problem is that 

DFE alpha highly overestimated the demography changes (in the simulations the N is mantained constant, so there are no demography changes).

The authors suggest another method that is as good as the DFE-alpha without the necessity of invoquing demographic changes.},

abstract = {Proteins often differ in amino-acid sequence across species. This difference has evolved by the accumulation of neutral mutations by random drift, the fixation of adaptive mutations by selection, or a mixture of the two. Here we propose a simple statistical test of the neutral protein evolution hypothesis based on a comparison of the number of amino-acid replacement substitutions to synonymous substitutions in the coding region of a locus. If the observed substitutions are neutral, the ratio of replacement to synonymous fixed differences between species should be the same as the ratio of replacement to synonymous polymorphisms within species. DNA sequence data on the Adh locus (encoding alcohol dehydrogenase, EC 1.1.1.1) in three species in the Drosophila melanogaster species subgroup do not fit this expectation; instead, there are more fixed replacement differences between species than expected. We suggest that these excess replacement substitutions result from adaptive fixation of selectively advantageous mutations.},

@article{Abzhanov2006,
abstract = {A classic textbook example of adaptive radiation under natural selection is the evolution of 14 closely related species of Darwin's finches (Fringillidae, Passeriformes), whose primary diversity lies in the size and shape of their beaks. Thus, ground finches have deep and wide beaks, cactus finches have long and pointed beaks (low depth and narrower width), and warbler finches have slender and pointed beaks, reflecting differences in their respective diets. Previous work has shown that even small differences in any of the three major dimensions (depth, width and length) of the beak have major consequences for the overall fitness of the birds. Recently we used a candidate gene approach to explain one pathway involved in Darwin's finch beak morphogenesis. However, this type of analysis is limited to molecules with a known association with craniofacial and/or skeletogenic development. Here we use a less constrained, complementary DNA microarray analysis of the transcripts expressed in the beak primordia to find previously unknown genes and pathways whose expression correlates with specific beak morphologies. We show that calmodulin (CaM), a molecule involved in mediating Ca2+ signalling, is expressed at higher levels in the long and pointed beaks of cactus finches than in more robust beak types of other species. We validated this observation with in situ hybridizations. When this upregulation of the CaM-dependent pathway is artificially replicated in the chick frontonasal prominence, it causes an elongation of the upper beak, recapitulating the beak morphology of the cactus finches. Our results indicate that local upregulation of the CaM-dependent pathway is likely to have been a component of the evolution of Darwin's finch species with elongated beak morphology and provide a mechanistic explanation for the independence of beak evolution along different axes. More generally, our results implicate the CaM-dependent pathway in the developmental regulation of craniofacial skeletal structures.},

abstract = {Codon usage bias (CUB) is a ubiquitous observation in molecular evolution. As a model, Drosophila has been particularly well-studied and indications show that selection at least partially controls codon usage, probably through selection for translational efficiency. Although many aspects of Drosophila CUB have been studied, this is the first study relating codon usage to development in this holometabolous insect with very different life stages. Here we ask the question: What developmental stage of Drosophila melanogaster has the greatest CUB? Genes with maximum expression in the larval stage have the greatest overall CUB when compared with embryos, pupae, and adults. (The same pattern was observed in Drosophila pseudoobscura, see Supplementary Material online.) We hypothesize this is related to the very rapid growth of larvae, placing increased selective pressure to produce large amounts of protein: a 300-fold increase requiring an approximate doubling of protein content every 10 h. Genes with highest expression in adult males and early embryos, stages with the least de novo protein synthesis, display the least CUB. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that CUB is caused (at least in part) by selection for efficient protein production. This seems to hold on the individual gene level (highly expressed genes are more biased than lowly expressed genes) as well as on a more global scale where genes with maximum expression during times of very rapid growth and protein synthesis are more biased than genes with maximum expression during times of low growth.},

However, the mechanism by which nSR100 controls its target exons is poorly understood. We demonstrate that nSR100-dependent neural exons are associated with a unique configuration of intronic cis-elements that promote rapid switch-like regulation during neurogenesis. A key feature of this configuration is the insertion of specialized intronic enhancers between polypyrimidine tracts and acceptor sites that bind nSR100 to potently activate exon inclusion in neural cells while weakening 3' splice site recognition and contributing to exon skipping in nonneural cells. nSR100 further operates by forming multiple interactions with early spliceosome components bound proximal to 3' splice sites. These multifaceted interactions achieve dominance over neural exon silencing mediated by the splicing regulator PTBP1. The results thus illuminate a widespread mechanism by which a critical neural exon network is activated during neurogenesis.},

Here we uncover behavioural and developmental genetic mechanisms that enable water striders to survive attacks by bottom-striking predators. Long midlegs, critical for antipredator strategy, are shaped through a lineage-specific interaction between the Hox protein Ultrabithorax (Ubx) and a new target gene called gilt. The differences in leg morphologies are established through modulation of gilt differential expression between mid and hindlegs under Ubx control. Furthermore, short-legged water striders, generated through gilt RNAi knockdown, exhibit reduced performance in predation tests. Therefore, the evolution of the new Ubx-gilt interaction contributes to shaping the legs that enable water striders to dodge predator strikes. These data show how divergent selection, associated with novel prey-predator interactions, can favour the evolution of new genetic interactions and drive adaptive evolution.},

@article{Tuller2008,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: The evolutionary rate of a protein is a basic measure of evolution at the molecular level. Previous studies have shown that genes expressed in the brain have significantly lower evolutionary rates than those expressed in somatic tissues.

RESULTS: We study the evolutionary rates of genes expressed in 21 different human brain regions. We find that genes highly expressed in the more recent cortical regions of the brain have lower evolutionary rates than genes highly expressed in subcortical regions. This may partially result from the observation that genes that are highly expressed in cortical regions tend to be highly expressed in subcortical regions, and thus their evolution faces a richer set of functional constraints. The frequency of mammal-specific and primate-specific genes is higher in the highly expressed gene sets of subcortical brain regions than in those of cortical brain regions. The basic inverse correlation between evolutionary rate and gene expression is significantly stronger in brain versus nonbrain tissues, and in cortical versus subcortical regions. Extending upon this cortical/subcortical trend, this inverse correlation is generally more marked for tissues that are located higher along the cranial vertical axis during development, giving rise to the possibility that these tissues are also more evolutionarily recent.

CONCLUSIONS: We find that cortically expressed genes are more conserved than subcortical ones, and that gene expression levels exert stronger constraints on sequence evolution in cortical versus subcortical regions. Taken together, these findings suggest that cortically expressed genes are under stronger selective pressure than subcortically expressed genes.},

abstract = {The original eukaryotic cell may have possessed the key processes necessary for metazoan development--cell differentiation, patterning and motility--and these are present in the cell cycle. Protozoa also possess key patterning processes. It remains a problem as to why there should be two main modes of development--one based on asymmetric cell division and the other on cellular interactions. The latter may be related to asexual reproduction. The morphogenetic movements of gastrulation--as distinct from specifying the body plan--are highly conserved in a wide variety of organisms. This may reflect the requirement for patterning being specified in two dimensions, sheets of cells, and a third dimension being created by cell infolding. The origin of the gastrula can be accounted for in terms of Haeckel's gastrea theory--an early metazoan resembling the gastrula. Gastrulation in Cnidaria may resemble the primitive condition but there is nevertheless considerable diversity. While this may reflect, for example, yolkiness, it seems that there is little selection on developmental processes other than for reliability. Thus it is possible that the embryo is privileged with respect to selection and this may help account for the evolution of novel processes like the origin of the neural crest. Reliability is the key demand made on development. This may be provided by apparent redundancy.

abstract = {Most bilaterian animals possess a through gut with a separate mouth and anus. It is commonly believed that during the transition from radial to bilateral symmetry, both openings evolved simultaneously by the lateral closure of a slit-like blastopore. Molecular phylogenies however, place the acoel flatworms, which have only one opening to their digestive system, as the sister group to all remaining Bilateria. To address how this single body opening is related to the mouth and anus of the protostomes and deuterostomes, we studied the expression of genes involved in bilaterian foregut and hindgut patterning during the development of the acoel Convolutriloba longifissura. Here we show that the genes brachyury and goosecoid are expressed in association with the acoel mouth, suggesting that this single opening is homologous to the mouth of other bilaterians. In addition, we find that the genes caudal, orthopedia and brachyury-which are expressed in various bilaterian hindguts-are expressed in a small region at the posterior end of the animal, separated from the anterior oral brachyury-expressing region by a dorsal domain of ectodermal bmp2/4 expression. These results contradict the hypothesis that the bilaterian mouth and anus evolved simultaneously from a common blastoporal opening, and suggest that a through gut might have evolved independently in different animal lineages.},

abstract = {Germ layers are defined as cell layers that arise during early animal development, mostly during gastrulation, and that give rise to all tissues and organs in adults. The evolutionary origin of the inner germ layers, endoderm and mesoderm, and their relationship have been a matter of debate for decades. In this review we summarize the major modes of endoderm and mesoderm formation found in Metazoa and possible evolutionary scenarios to reconstruct the ancestral state. In the second part, we address the question whether endoderm as well as mesoderm are homologous among Bilateria. In this regard, we propose that the comparative analysis of some crucial transcription factors involved in the early specification and differentiation of these germ layers might provide cues for the level of homology. We focus on four classes of genes: the Zn-finger gene GATA 4-6, the bHLH gene twist, the Kr{\"{u}}ppel-like Zn-finger gene snail and the T-box gene brachyury. The role of each of these genes in mesendoderm formation is summarized and we propose that the specific function of each of these genes in endoderm and mesoderm formation evolved from the regulation of basic cellular features, such as cell adhesion, cell motility, cytoskeleton and cell cycle.},

abstract = {Bilateria are subdivided into Protostomia and Deuterostomia. Indirect development through primary, ciliary larvae occurs in both of these branches; however, the closing blastopore develops into mouth and anus in Protostomia and into anus only in Deuterostomia. Because of this important difference in larval gut ontogeny, the tube-shaped guts in protostome and deuterostome primary larvae are thought to have evolved independently. To test this hypothesis, we have analysed the expression of brachyury, otx and goosecoid homologues in the polychaete Platynereis dumerilii, which develops by means of a trochophora larva-the primary, ciliary larva prototypic for Protostomia. Here we show that brachyury expression in the ventral portion of the developing foregut in Platynereis and also otx expression along ciliated bands in the mouth region of the trochophora larva parallels expression in primary larvae in Deuterostomia. In addition, goosecoid expression in the foregut of Platynereis mirrors the function in higher Deuterostomia. We present molecular evidence for the evolutionary conservation of larval foreguts and mouth regions of Protostomia and Deuterostomia. Our data indicate that Urbilateria, the common bilaterian ancestors, developed through a primary, ciliary larva that already possessed a tripartite tube-shaped gut.},

However, the topologies of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling networks vary drastically in different animal groups, raising questions about the evolutionary constraints and evolvability of BMP signaling systems. Using loss-of-function analysis and mathematical modeling, we show that two signaling centers expressing different BMPs and BMP antagonists maintain the secondary axis of the sea anemone Nematostella. We demonstrate that BMP signaling is required for asymmetric Hox gene expression and mesentery formation. Computational analysis reveals that network parameters related to BMP4 and Chordin are constrained both in Nematostella and Xenopus, while those describing the BMP signaling modulators can vary significantly. Notably, only chordin, but not bmp4 expression needs to be spatially restricted for robust signaling gradient formation. Our data provide an explanation of the evolvability of BMP signaling systems in axis formation throughout Eumetazoa.},

abstract = {Despite considerable differences in morphology and complexity of body plans among animals, a great part of the gene set is shared among Bilateria and their basally branching sister group, the Cnidaria. This suggests that the common ancestor of eumetazoans already had a highly complex gene repertoire. At present it is therefore unclear how morphological diversification is encoded in the genome. Here we address the possibility that differences in gene regulation could contribute to the large morphological divergence between cnidarians and bilaterians. To this end, we generated the first genome-wide map of gene regulatory elements in a nonbilaterian animal, the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by deep sequencing of five chromatin modifications and a transcriptional cofactor, we identified over 5000 enhancers in the Nematostella genome and could validate 75{\%} of the tested enhancers in vivo. We found that in Nematostella, but not in yeast, enhancers are characterized by the same combination of histone modifications as in bilaterians, and these enhancers preferentially target developmental regulatory genes. Surprisingly, the distribution and abundance of gene regulatory elements relative to these genes are shared between Nematostella and bilaterian model organisms. Our results suggest that complex gene regulation originated at least 600 million yr ago, predating the common ancestor of eumetazoans.},

abstract = {The fundamental equation in evolutionary quantitative genetics, the Lande equation, describes the response to directional selection as a product of the additive genetic variance and the selection gradient of trait value on relative fitness. Comparisons of both genetic variances and selection gradients across traits or populations require standardization, as both are scale dependent. The Lande equation can be standardized in two ways. Standardizing by the variance of the selected trait yields the response in units of standard deviation as the product of the heritability and the variance-standardized selection gradient. This standardization conflates selection and variation because the phenotypic variance is a function of the genetic variance. Alternatively, one can standardize the Lande equation using the trait mean, yielding the proportional response to selection as the product of the squared coefficient of additive genetic variance and the mean-standardized selection gradient. Mean-standardized selection gradients are particularly useful for summarizing the strength of selection because the mean-standardized gradient for fitness itself is one, a convenient benchmark for strong selection. We review published estimates of directional selection in natural populations using mean-standardized selection gradients. Only 38 published studies provided all the necessary information for calculation of mean-standardized gradients. The median absolute value of multivariate mean-standardized gradients shows that selection is on average 54{\%} as strong as selection on fitness. Correcting for the upward bias introduced by taking absolute values lowers the median to 31{\%}, still very strong selection. Such large estimates clearly cannot be representative of selection on all traits. Some possible sources of overestimation of the strength of selection include confounding environmental and genotypic effects on fitness, the use of fitness components as proxies for fitness, and biases in publication or choice of traits to study.},

Although housekeeping genes have been reported to show clustering in the animal genomes, whether the genes comprising a given regulatory network are physically clustered on a chromosome is uncertain. We examined this question in the present study. Ascidians are the closest living relatives of vertebrates, and their tadpole-type larva represents the basic body plan of chordates. The Ciona intestinalis genome contains 390 core TF genes and 119 major ST genes. Previous gene disruption assays led to the formulation of a basic chordate embryonic blueprint, based on over 3000 genetic interactions among 79 zygotic regulatory genes. Here, we mapped the regulatory genes, including all 79 regulatory genes, on the 14 pairs of Ciona chromosomes by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). Chromosomal localization of upstream and downstream regulatory genes demonstrates that the components of coherent developmental gene networks are evenly distributed over the 14 chromosomes. Thus, this study provides the first comprehensive evidence that the physical clustering of regulatory genes, or their target genes, is not relevant for the genome-wide control of gene expression during development.},

The positions of cells contributing to the CNS were reconstructed from confocal image stacks of embryonic nuclei, and maps of successive stages were used to chart the mitotic descent, thereby creating a cell lineage for each cell. The entire CNS is formed from 10th- to 14th-generation cells. Although minor differences exist in cell position, lineage is invariant in cells derived from A-line blastomeres, which form the caudal nerve cord and visceral ganglion. We document the lineage of five pairs of presumed motor neurons within the visceral ganglion: one pair arises from A/A 10.57, and four from progeny of A/A 9.30. The remaining cells of the visceral ganglion are in their 13th and 14th generations at hatching, with most mitotic activity ceasing around 85{\%} of embryonic development.

Neurulation commences in a posterior to anterior wave following in the wake of the ninth cleavage, when all cells, except possibly four, are in their 10th generation. The neural plate then comprises 76 cells, in up to four posterior rows each of eight vegetal-hemisphere cells, and eight anterior rows each of six animal-hemisphere cells. Two cells are lost from the neural plate to the muscle cell line during neurulation and four cells are gained from ectoderm outside the plate. All cells become wedge-shaped. Simple, stereotyped positional changes transform cells from lateral locations in the plate to posterior locations in the tube; bilateral partners shear their midline positions to form the keel, and ectodermal cells zipper up dorsally to form the capstone, of a tube which is four cells in cross section posteriorly, but more complex anteriorly. Neither cell death nor migration occur during neurulation. Divisions become asynchronous and the cell-cycle extends; 170 10th- to 12th-generation cells exist by the time the neural tube becomes completely internalized. Generally, only one further division is required to complete the lineage analysis, two at the most. Neural plate cell divisions were invariant using our observational methods, and their lineage is compared with that from recent studies of H. Nishida (1987, Dev. Biol. 121, 526-541).},

In this review, we describe ascidian embryogenesis and its cell lineages, introduce several characteristics of ascidian embryos, describe recent advances in understanding of the mechanisms of cell fate specification, and discuss them in the context of what is known in vertebrates and other organisms.},

abstract = {Ascidians and vertebrates belong to the Phylum Chordata and both have dorsal tubular central nervous systems. The structure of the ascidian neural tube is extremely simple, containing less than 400 cells, among which less than 100 cells are neurons. Recent studies suggest that, despite its simple organization, the mechanisms patterning the ascidian neural tube are similar to those of the more complex vertebrate brain. Identification of homologous regions between vertebrate and ascidian nervous systems, however, remains to be resolved. Here we report the expression of HrPax-258 gene: an ascidian homologue of vertebrate Pax-2, Pax-5 and Pax-8 genes. Molecular phylogenetic analyses indicate that HrPax-258 is descendant from a single precursor gene that gave rise to the three vertebrate genes. The expression pattern of HrPax-258 suggests that this subfamily of Pax genes has conserved roles in regional specification of the brain. Comparison with expression of ascidian Otx (Hroth) and a Hox gene (HrHox1) by double-staining in situ hybridizations indicate that the ascidian brain region can be subdivided into three regions; the anterior region marked by Hroth probably homologous to the vertebrate forebrain and midbrain, the middle region marked by HrPax-258 probably homologous to the vertebrate anterior hindbrain (and maybe also midbrain) and the posterior region marked by Hox genes which is homologous to the vertebrate hindbrain and spinal cord. Later expression of HrPax-258 in atrial primordia implies that basal chordates such as ascidians have already acquired a sensory organ that develops from epidermal thickenings (placodes) and expresses HrPax-258; we suggest it is homologous to the vertebrate ear. Therefore, placodes are not likely to be a newly acquired feature in vertebrates, but may have already been possessed by the earliest chordates.},

Their larvae display a typical chordate body plan, but are composed of a remarkably small number of cells. Ascidians develop with an invariant cell lineage, and their embryos can be easily experimentally manipulated during the cleavage stages. Their larval nervous system is organised in a similar way as in vertebrates but is composed of less than 130 neurones and around 230 glial cells. This remarkable simplicity offers an opportunity to understand, at the cellular and molecular levels, the ontogeny and function of each neural cell. Here, we first review the organisation of the ascidian nervous system and its lineage. We then focus on the current understanding of the processes of neural specification and patterning before and during gastrulation. We discuss these advances in the context of what is currently known in vertebrates.},

abstract = {The notochord is one of the characteristic features of the phylum Chordata. The vertebrate Brachyury gene is known to be essential for the terminal differentiation of chordamesoderm into notochord. In the ascidian, which belongs to the subphylum Urochordata, differentiation of notochord cells is induced at the late phase of the 32-cell stage through cellular interaction with adjacent endoderm cells as well as neighboring notochord cells. The ascidian Brachyury gene (As-T) is expressed exclusively in the notochord-lineage blastomeres, and the timing of gene expression at the 64-cell stage precisely coincides with that of the developmental fate restriction of the blastomeres. In addition, experimental studies have demonstrated a close relationship between the inductive events and As-T expression. In the present study, we show that overexpression of As-T by microinjection of the synthesized As-T RNA results in the occurrence, without the induction, of notochord-specific features in the A-line presumptive notochord blastomeres. We also show that overexpression of As-T RNA leads to ectopic expression of notochord-specific features in non-notochord lineages, including those of spinal cord and endoderm. These results strongly suggest that the developmental role of the Brachyury is conserved throughout chordates in notochord formation.},

abstract = {The T-box genes, including Brachyury, encode a novel family of transcription factors that play critical roles in various processes of development, in particular, mesoderm formation in chordate embryos. In the case of the ascidian Halocynthia roretzi, the Brachyury (As-T) is expressed exclusively in notochord cells, whereas another T-box gene (As-T2) is expressed in the muscle cells and in the tip of the tail of tailbud embryos. In a previous study, we suggested that the combined pattern of the spatial expressions of As-T and As-T2 appears to correspond to that of a single vertebrate Brachyury gene (Yasuo et al., Dev Biol 1996;180:773-779). The present molecular phylogenetic analysis suggested that As-T2 is a divergent member of the T-box family with a similarity to the Tbx6 subfamily. Vertebrate members of this subfamily are expressed in the posterior paraxial mesoderm, and the mouse Tbx6 is essential for the specification of posterior somite. To investigate the function of As-T2, we examined an ectopic- and/or overexpression of this gene by injecting synthetic mRNA into fertilized eggs. The results showed that the injection of As-T2 mRNA induced an ectopic expression of muscle-specific myosin heavy-chain gene and actin gene, especially in presumptive epidermal cells. This ectopic muscle-specific expression was accompanied by the partial suppression of an epidermis-specific gene expression. The overexpression of As-T2, however, rarely affected the expression of As-T (Brachyury) and genes that are expressed in the tailbud.},

abstract = {The notochord is one of the defining features of chordates. The ascidian notochord is a rod like structure consisting of a single row of 40 cells. The anterior 32 ;primary' notochord cells arise from the A-line (anterior vegetal) blastomeres of the eight-cell stage embryo, whereas the posterior 8 ;secondary' notochord cells arise from the B-line (posterior vegetal) blastomeres of the eight-cell stage embryo. Specification of notochord precursors within these two lineages occurs in a spatially and temporally distinct manner. We show that specification of the secondary but not the primary notochord in Ciona intestinalis requires a relay mechanism involving two signalling pathways. First, we show evidence that acquisition of secondary notochord fate is dependent upon lateral Nodal signalling sources, situated in the adjacent b-line animal cells. Expression of the notochord specific gene Ci-Brachyury in the secondary notochord precursor was downregulated following selective inhibition of Nodal signal reception in B-line derivatives and also, strikingly, following selective inhibition of Nodal signal reception in A-line cell derivatives. Within the A-line, Nodal signals are required for localised expression of Delta2, which encodes a divergent form of Delta ligand. Using four distinct reagents to inhibit Delta2/Notch signals, we showed that Delta2 signalling from A-line cells, which activates the Notch/Su(H) pathway in adjacent B-line cells, is required for specification of the secondary notochord precursor. We propose a model whereby laterally produced Nodal acts to specify the secondary notochord precursor both directly in the B-line cells and via Delta2 induction in adjacent A-line cells.},

abstract = {Ascidians are invertebrate chordates with a simple larval tadpole form containing a notochord and an overlying dorsal neural tube. As in vertebrates, the neural tube of ascidian larvae displays positional differences along the rostral-caudal and dorsal-ventral axes in terms of neuronal cell types generated, morphology and gene expression. However, how these differences are established in this simple chordate remains largely unknown. In this study, we show that a single blastomere named b6.5, which is situated in a lateral position in the 32-cell-stage embryo, is a source of signal(s) required for patterning across the medial-lateral axis (future ventral-dorsal axis) of the neural plate. We identify this signal as a Ciona homologue of Nodal, Ci-Nodal. Transcriptional activation of Ci-Nodal in b6.5 depends upon vegetally derived Ci-FGF9/16/20. Using three distinct reagents to inhibit Nodal signals, we show that Nodal signalling is required for neural plate patterning across the medial-lateral axis and that, in the absence of this signal, the caudal-lateral part of the neural plate adopts a medial-like fate. Secondary muscle fate is similarly affected. We conclude that specification of the lateral neural plate is initiated by signalling sources laterally flanking the neural plate and involves a cell-fate choice between lateral and medial neural fates, with Nodal signalling promoting lateral fate. This role for Nodal signalling during ascidian neural plate patterning contrasts with that in vertebrates, where it is implicated in promoting a medial neural fate, the floor plate.},

abstract = {Mesodermal tissues arise from diverse cell lineages and molecular strategies in the Ciona embryo. For example, the notochord and mesenchyme are induced by FGF/MAPK signaling, whereas the tail muscles are specified autonomously by the localized determinant, Macho-1. A unique mesoderm lineage, the trunk lateral cells, develop from a single pair of endomesoderm cells, the A6.3 blastomeres, which form part of the anterior endoderm, hematopoietic mesoderm and muscle derivatives. MAPK signaling is active in the endoderm descendants of A6.3, but is absent from the mesoderm lineage. Inhibition of MAPK signaling results in expanded expression of mesoderm marker genes and loss of endoderm markers, whereas ectopic MAPK activation produces the opposite phenotype: the transformation of mesoderm into endoderm. Evidence is presented that a specific Ephrin signaling molecule, Ci-ephrin-Ad, is required to establish asymmetric MAPK signaling in the endomesoderm. Reducing Ci-ephrin-Ad activity via morpholino injection results in ectopic MAPK signaling and conversion of the mesoderm lineage into endoderm. Conversely, misexpression of Ci-ephrin-Ad in the endoderm induces ectopic activation of mesodermal marker genes. These results extend recent observations regarding the role of Ephrin signaling in the establishment of asymmetric cell fates in the Ciona notochord and neural tube.},

All of the 1,003 clusters were subjected to whole-mount in situ hybridization to analyze the distribution of the maternal mRNAs in fertilized eggs, and a total of 329 genes showed localized distribution of the mRNAs: 16 showed cortical localization, 12 showed mitochondrial-like distribution, 99 crescent-like distribution, 63 partial localization, and 139 weak localization. When the distribution pattern of all the maternally expressed mRNAs was examined in the 8-cell stage embryos, it became evident that 248 genes which have localized mRNA patterns at the fertilized egg stage lose their localized distribution by the 8-cell stage. In contrast, 13 genes newly gain a localized pattern by the 8-cell stage. In addition, a total of 39 genes showed distinct in situ signals in the nucleus of blastomeres of the 8-cell stage embryo, suggesting early zygotic expression of these genes by this stage. These results suggest that complicated cytoplasmic movements are associated with the characteristic distribution of maternal mRNAs, which in turn support proper embryonic axis formation and establishment of the genetic network for embryonic cell specification.},

Multicellular animals display a stunning diversity of shapes and sizes of their bodies and individual suborganismal structures, much of it important to their survival. What is the most efficient way to study the evolution of morphological diversity? The old-new field of evolutionary developmental biology (evo-devo) can be particularly useful for understanding the origins of animal forms, as it aims to consolidate advances from disparate fields such as phylogenetics, genomics, morphometrics, cell biology, and developmental biology. We analyze the structure of some of the most successful recent evo-devo studies, which we see as having three distinct but highly interdependent components: (a) morphometrics, (b) identification of candidate mechanisms, and (c) functional experiments. Our case studies illustrate how multifarious evo-devo approaches taken within the three-winged evo-devo research program explain developmental mechanisms for morphological evolution across different phylogenetic scales.},

abstract = {There are few putative macroevolutionary trends or rules that withstand scrutiny. Here, we test and verify the purported tendency for animal clades to reach their maximum morphological variety relatively early in their evolutionary histories (early high disparity). We present a meta-analysis of 98 metazoan clades radiating throughout the Phanerozoic. The disparity profiles of groups through time are summarized in terms of their center of gravity (CG), with values above and below 0.50 indicating top- and bottom-heaviness, respectively. Clades that terminate at one of the "big five" mass extinction events tend to have truncated trajectories, with a significantly top-heavy CG distribution overall. The remaining 63 clades show the opposite tendency, with a significantly bottom-heavy mean CG (relatively early high disparity). Resampling tests are used to identify groups with a CG significantly above or below 0.50; clades not terminating at a mass extinction are three times more likely to be significantly bottom-heavy than top-heavy. Overall, there is no clear temporal trend in disparity profile shapes from the Cambrian to the Recent, and early high disparity is the predominant pattern throughout the Phanerozoic. Our results do not allow us to distinguish between ecological and developmental explanations for this phenomenon. To the extent that ecology has a role, however, the paucity of bottom-heavy clades radiating in the immediate wake of mass extinctions suggests that early high disparity more probably results from the evolution of key apomorphies at the base of clades rather than from physical drivers or catastrophic ecospace clearing.},

abstract = {Developmental changes in the temporal and spatial regulation of gene expression drive the emergence of normal mature brain function, while disruptions in these processes underlie many neurodevelopmental abnormalities. To solidify our foundational knowledge of such changes in a primate brain with an extended period of postnatal maturation like in human, we investigated the whole-genome transcriptional profiles of rhesus monkey brains from birth to adulthood. We found that gene expression dynamics are largest from birth through infancy, after which gene expression profiles transition to a relatively stable state by young adulthood. Biological pathway enrichment analysis revealed that genes more highly expressed at birth are associated with cell adhesion and neuron differentiation, while genes more highly expressed in juveniles and adults are associated with cell death. Neocortex showed significantly greater differential expression over time than subcortical structures, and this trend likely reflects the protracted postnatal development of the cortex. Using network analysis, we identified 27 co-expression modules containing genes with highly correlated expression patterns that are associated with specific brain regions, ages or both. In particular, one module with high expression in neonatal cortex and striatum that decreases during infancy and juvenile development was significantly enriched for autism spectrum disorder (ASD)-related genes. This network was enriched for genes associated with axon guidance and interneuron differentiation, consistent with a disruption in the formation of functional cortical circuitry in ASD.},

abstract = {Genome-wide resources, such as collections of cDNA clones encoding for complete proteins (full-ORF clones), are crucial tools for studying the evolution of gene function and genetic interactions. Non-model organisms, in particular marine organisms, provide a rich source of functional diversity. Marine organism genomes are, however, frequently highly polymorphic and encode proteins that diverge significantly from those of well-annotated model genomes. The construction of full-ORF clone collections from non-model organisms is hindered by the difficulty of predicting accurately the N-terminal ends of proteins, and distinguishing recent paralogs from highly polymorphic alleles. We report a computational strategy that overcomes these difficulties, and allows for accurate gene level clustering of transcript data followed by the automated identification of full-ORFs with correct 5'- and 3'-ends. It is robust to polymorphism, includes paralog calling and does not require evolutionary proximity to well annotated model organisms. We developed this pipeline for the ascidian Ciona intestinalis, a highly polymorphic member of the divergent sister group of the vertebrates, emerging as a powerful model organism to study chordate gene function, Gene Regulatory Networks and molecular mechanisms underlying human pathologies. Using this pipeline we have generated the first full-ORF collection for a highly polymorphic marine invertebrate. It contains 19,163 full-ORF cDNA clones covering 60{\%} of Ciona coding genes, and full-ORF orthologs for approximately half of curated human disease-associated genes.},

RNAi screens in other organisms promise to reduce this bias. Here we present the results of the iBeetle screen, a large-scale, unbiased RNAi screen in the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum, which identifies gene functions in embryonic and postembryonic development, physiology and cell biology. The utility of Tribolium as a screening platform is demonstrated by the identification of genes involved in insect epithelial adhesion.

abstract = {Evolution of animal body plans occurs with changes in the encoded genomic programs that direct development, by alterations in the structure of encoded developmental gene-regulatory networks (GRNs). However, study of this most fundamental of evolutionary processes requires experimentally tractable, phylogenetically divergent organisms that differ morphologically while belonging to the same monophyletic clade, plus knowledge of the relevant GRNs operating in at least one of the species. These conditions are met in the divergent embryogenesis of the two extant, morphologically distinct, echinoid (sea urchin) subclasses, Euechinoidea and Cidaroidea, which diverged from a common late Paleozoic ancestor. Here we focus on striking differences in the mode of embryonic skeletogenesis in a euechinoid, the well-known model Strongylocentrotus purpuratus (Sp), vs. the cidaroid Eucidaris tribuloides (Et). At the level of descriptive embryology, skeletogenesis in Sp and Et has long been known to occur by distinct means. The complete GRN controlling this process is known for Sp. We carried out targeted functional analyses on Et skeletogenesis to identify the presence, or demonstrate the absence, of specific regulatory linkages and subcircuits key to the operation of the Sp skeletogenic GRN. Remarkably, most of the canonical design features of the Sp skeletogenic GRN that we examined are either missing or operate differently in Et. This work directly implies a dramatic reorganization of genomic regulatory circuitry concomitant with the divergence of the euechinoids, which began before the end-Permian extinction.},

abstract = {Evolutionary developmental biology (evo-devo) suggests a distinction between modular and systemic variation. In the case of modular change, the conservation of the overall structure helps recognizing affinities, while a single, fast evolving module is likely to produce a bonanza for the taxonomist, while systemic changes produce strongly deviating morphologies that cause problems in tracing homologies. Similarly, changes affecting the whole life cycle are more challenging than those limited to one stage. Developmental modularity is a precondition for heterochrony. Analyzing a matrix of morphological data for paedomorphic taxa requires special care. It is, however, possible to extract phylogenetic signal from heterochronic patterns. The taxonomist should pay attention to the intricacies of the genotype→phenotype map. When using genetic data to infer phylogeny, a comparison of gene sequences is just a first step. To bridge the gap between genes and morphology we should consider the spatial and temporal patterns of gene expression, and their regulation. Minor genetic change can have major phenotypic effects, sometimes suggesting saltational evolution. Evo-devo is also relevant in respect to speciation: changes in developmental schedules are often implicated in the divergence between sympatric morphs, and a developmental modulation of ‘temporal phenotypes' appears to be responsible for many cases of speciation.},

We uncovered an ancestral developmental potential to produce a "supersoldier" subcaste that has been actualized at least two times independently in the hyperdiverse ant genus Pheidole. This potential has been retained and can be environmentally induced throughout the genus. Therefore, the retention and induction of this potential have facilitated the parallel evolution of supersoldiers through a process known as genetic accommodation.

They are able to induce the supersoldier phenotype in a Pheidole ant, using an analogue of the Juvenile Hormone.

Water striders, a group of hemipteran insects, present a unique example of adaptation to life on the fluid water surface substrate. The group has undergone a set of leg modifications allowing them to efficiently move on the water surface and hence invade a variety of niches from ponds to open oceans. The elongated legs of water striders play a key role in generating efficient movement on the fluid by acting as propelling oars.RESULTS:To determine the developmental mechanisms underlying leg elongation, we examined the function of the key developmental genes decapentaplegic (dpp), wingless (wg), epidermal growth factor receptor (egfr), and hedgehog (hh) during embryonic development in the water strider Limnoporus dissortis. By analyzing expression patterns and RNAi knockdown phenotypes, we uncover the role of these genes in leg growth and patterning during embryogenesis. Our results indicate that wg and egfr contribute to the elongation of all the three segments of all thoracic legs, whereas hh specifies distal leg segments.CONCLUSIONS:Together, our results suggest that key patterning genes contribute to the dramatic elongation of thoracic appendages in water striders.},

Similarly, evolutionary ecology has greatly advanced our understanding of the relationship between the phenotype and the environment. To fully understand the evolution of organismal diversity, a thorough integration of these two fields is required. This integration remains highly challenging because model systems offering a rich ecological and evolutionary background, together with the availability of developmental genetic tools and genomic resources, are scarce. In this review, we introduce the semi-aquatic bugs (Gerromorpha, Heteroptera) as original models well suited to study why and how organisms diversify. The Gerromorpha invaded water surfaces over 200 mya and diversified into a range of remarkable new forms within this new ecological habitat. We summarize the biology and evolutionary history of this group of insects and highlight a set of characters associated with the habitat change and the diversification that followed. We further discuss the morphological, behavioral, molecular and genomic tools available that together make semi-aquatic bugs a prime model for integration across disciplines. We present case studies showing how the implementation and combination of these approaches can advance our understanding of how the interaction between genotypes, phenotypes and the environment drives the evolution of distinct morphologies. Finally, we explain how the same set of experimental designs can be applied in other systems to address similar biological questions.},

At the level of gene expression it seems also clear that the embryo becomes progressively compartmentalized over time and space. However, there have not been any systematic attempts to quantify how this occurs. Here, we present a quantitative analysis of the compartmentalization and spatial complexity of gene expression in Drosophila melanogaster over developmental time by analyzing thousands of gene expression spatial patterns from FlyExpress database. We use three different mathematical measures of compartmentalization of gene expression in space. All these measures show a similar non-linear increase in compartmentalization over time, with the most dramatic change occurring from the maternal to the early gastrula stage. Transcription factors and growth factors showed an earlier compartmentalization. Finally, we partitioned the embryo space in 257 equally sized regions and clustered them depending on their expression similarity, within and between stages. This provides a global overview about the effective degree of differentiation and compartmentalization between body parts at each developmental stage and when and where in the embryo there are more changes, due to signaling or movement.},

abstract = {Ascidians, belonging to the subphylum Urochordata, the earliest branch from the lineage to the vertebrates, exhibit a prototypical morphogenesis of chordates in the larval development, although they subsequently metamorphose into adults with a unique body structure. Recent draft genome analysis of the ascidian Ciona intestinalis has identified 9 Hox genes, which, however, have been located on five scaffolds. Similarly, expression patterns of Ciona Hox genes are largely unknown, although some data have been available for a few Hox member genes. Thus, the cluster structure and colinearity of Hox genes are still an enigma in C. intestinalis. To address these issues, we used fluorescence in situ hybridization and whole-mount in situ hybridization techniques and examined the genomic organization and spatiotemporal expression of all Hox as well as extended Hox member genes (Evx and Mox) of C. intestinalis. We found that seven of nine Ciona Hox genes are located on a single chromosome with some ordering exceptions, and the other genes, including Evx and Mox, are located on three other chromosomes.

Variations of Hox genes among animal species in the number, order on a chromosome, and the developmental expression pattern may reflect an evolutionary history. Therefore, it is definitely necessary to characterize Hox genes of wide variety of animal species, especially the species occupying key positions in the animal phylogeny. Ascidians, belonging to the subphylum Urochordata, are one of the sister groups of vertebrates in the phylum Chordata. Recent studies have shown that nine Hox genes of Ciona intestinalis, an ascidian species, are present on two chromosomes in the genome. In this review, we discuss the present state of Hox genes in ascidians, focusing on their novel chromosomal organization and expression pattern with unique features and how the novel organization has evolved in relation to the unique body plan of ascidians.},

abstract = {The tripartite organization of the central nervous system (CNS) may be an ancient character of the bilaterians. However, the elaboration of the more complex vertebrate brain depends on the midbrain-hindbrain boundary (MHB) organizer, which is absent in invertebrates such as Drosophila. The Fgf8 signaling molecule expressed in the MHB organizer plays a key role in delineating separate mesencephalon and metencephalon compartments in the vertebrate CNS. Here, we present evidence that an Fgf8 ortholog establishes sequential patterns of regulatory gene expression in the developing posterior sensory vesicle, and the interleaved ;neck' region located between the sensory vesicle and visceral ganglion of the simple chordate Ciona intestinalis. The detailed characterization of gene networks in the developing CNS led to new insights into the mechanisms by which Fgf8/17/18 patterns the chordate brain. The precise positioning of this Fgf signaling activity depends on an unusual AND/OR network motif that regulates Snail, which encodes a threshold repressor of Fgf8 expression. Nodal is sufficient to activate low levels of the Snail repressor within the neural plate, while the combination of Nodal and Neurogenin produces high levels of Snail in neighboring domains of the CNS. The loss of Fgf8 patterning activity results in the transformation of hindbrain structures into an expanded mesencephalon in both ascidians and vertebrates, suggesting that the primitive MHB-like activity predates the vertebrate CNS.},

abstract = {Growth control scales morphological attributes and, therefore, provides a critical contribution to the evolution of adaptive traits. Yet, the genetic mechanisms underlying growth in the context of specific ecological adaptations are poorly understood. In water striders, adaptation to locomotion on the water surface is associated with allometric and functional changes in thoracic appendages, such that T2-legs, used as propelling oars, are longer than T3-legs, used as steering rudders. The Hox gene Ubx establishes this derived morphology by elongating T2-legs but shortening T3-legs. Using gene expression assays, RNAi knockdown, and comparative transcriptomics, we demonstrate that the evolution of water surface rowing as a novel means of locomotion is associated with the evolution of a dose-dependent promoting-repressing effect of Ubx on leg growth. In the water strider Limnoporus dissortis, T3-legs express six to seven times higher levels of Ubx compared to T2-legs. Ubx RNAi shortens T2-legs and the severity of this phenotype increases with increased depletion of Ubx protein. Conversely, Ubx RNAi lengthens T3-legs but this phenotype is partially rescued when Ubx protein is further depleted. This dose-dependent effect of Ubx on leg growth is absent in non-rowing relatives that retain the ancestral relative leg length. We also show that the spatial patterns of expression of dpp, wg, hh, egfr, dll, exd, hth, and dac are unchanged in Ubx RNAi treatments. This indicates that the dose-dependent opposite effect of Ubx on T2- and T3-legs operates without any apparent effect on the spatial expression of major leg patterning genes. Our data suggest that scaling of adaptive allometries can evolve through changes in the levels of expression of Hox proteins early during ontogeny, and in the sensitivity of the tissues that express them, without any major effects on pattern formation.},

abstract = {Modules can be defined as quasi-autonomous units that are connected loosely with each other within a system. A need for the concept of modularity has emerged as we deal with evolving organisms in evolutionary developmental research, especially because it is unknown how genes are associated with anatomical patterns. One of the strategies to link genotypes with phenotypes could be to relate developmental modules with morphological ones. To do this, it is fundamental to grasp the context in which certain anatomical units and developmental processes are associated with each other specifically. By identifying morphological modularities as units recognized by some categories of general homology as established by comparative anatomy, it becomes possible to identify developmental modules whose genetic components exhibit coextensive expressions. This permits us to distinguish the evolutionary modification in which the identical morphological module simply alters its shape for adaptation, without being decoupled from the functioning gene network ('coupled modularities'), from the evolution of novelty that involves a heterotopic shift between the anatomical and developmental modules. Using this formulation, it becomes possible, within the realm of Geoffroy's homologous networks, to reduce morphological homologies to developmental mechanistic terms by dissociating certain classes of modules that are often associated with actual shapes and functions.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The prospects of deciphering the genetic program underlying embryonic development were recently boosted by the generation of large sets of precisely organized quantitative molecular data. In contrast, although the precise arrangement, interactions, and shapes of cells are crucial for the fulfilment of this program, their description remains coarse and qualitative. To bridge this gap, we developed a generic software, 3D Virtual Embryo, to quantify the geometry and interactions of cells in interactive three-dimensional embryo models. We applied this approach to early ascidian embryos, chosen because of their simplicity and their phylogenetic proximity to vertebrates.

RESULTS: We generated a collection of 19 interactive ascidian embryos between the 2- and 44-cell stages. We characterized the evolution with time, and in different cell lineages, of the volume of cells and of eight mathematical descriptors of their geometry, and we measured the surface of contact between neighboring blastomeres. These analyses first revealed that early embryonic blastomeres adopt a surprising variety of shapes, which appeared to be under strict and dynamic developmental control. Second, we found novel asymmetric cell divisions in the posterior vegetal lineages, which gave birth to sister cells with different fates. Third, during neural induction, differences in the area of contact between individual competent animal cells and inducing vegetal blastomeres appeared important to select the induced cells.

CONCLUSIONS: In addition to novel insight into both cell-autonomous and inductive processes controlling early ascidian development, we establish a generic conceptual framework for the quantitative analysis of embryo geometry that can be applied to other model organisms.},

abstract = {The dorsoventral and anteroposterior axes of the ascidian embryo are defined before first cleavage by means of a series of reorganizations that reposition cytoplasmic and cortical domains established during oogenesis. These domains situated in the periphery of the oocyte contain developmental determinants and a population of maternal postplasmic/PEM RNAs. One of these RNAs (macho-1) is a determinant for the muscle cells of the tadpole embryo. Oocytes acquire a primary animal-vegetal (a-v) axis during meiotic maturation, when a subcortical mitochondria-rich domain (myoplasm) and a domain rich in cortical endoplasmic reticulum (cER) and maternal postplasmic/PEM RNAs (cER-mRNA domain) become polarized and asymmetrically enriched in the vegetal hemisphere. Fertilization at metaphase of meiosis I initiates a series of dramatic cytoplasmic and cortical reorganizations of the zygote, which occur in two major phases. The first major phase depends on sperm entry which triggers a calcium wave leading in turn to an actomyosin-driven contraction wave. The contraction concentrates the cER-mRNA domain and myoplasm in and around a vegetal/contraction pole. The precise localization of the vegetal/contraction pole depends on both the a-v axis and the location of sperm entry and prefigures the future site of gastrulation and dorsal side of the embryo. The second major phase of reorganization occurs between meiosis completion and first cleavage. Sperm aster microtubules and then cortical microfilaments cause the cER-mRNA domain and myoplasm to reposition toward the posterior of the zygote. The location of the posterior pole depends on the localization of the sperm centrosome/aster attained during the first major phase of reorganization. Both cER-mRNA and myoplasm domains localized in the posterior region are partitioned equally between the first two blastomeres and then asymmetrically over the next two cleavages. At the eight-cell stage the cER-mRNA domain compacts and gives rise to a macroscopic cortical structure called the Centrosome Attracting Body (CAB). The CAB is responsible for a series of unequal divisions in posterior-vegetal blastomeres, and the postplasmic/PEM RNAs it contains are involved in patterning the posterior region of the embryo. In this review, we discuss these multiple events and phases of reorganizations in detail and their relationship to physiological, cell cycle, and cytoskeletal events. We also examine the role of the reorganizations in localizing determinants, postplasmic/PEM RNAs, and PAR polarity proteins in the cortex. Finally, we summarize some of the remaining questions concerning polarization of the ascidian embryo and provide comparisons to a few other species.

Non-model organisms, in particular marine organisms, provide a rich source of functional diversity. Marine organism genomes are, however, frequently highly polymorphic and encode proteins that diverge significantly from those of well-annotated model genomes. The construction of full-ORF clone collections from non-model organisms is hindered by the difficulty of predicting accurately the N-terminal ends of proteins, and distinguishing recent paralogs from highly polymorphic alleles. We report a computational strategy that overcomes these difficulties, and allows for accurate gene level clustering of transcript data followed by the automated identification of full-ORFs with correct 5'- and 3'-ends. It is robust to polymorphism, includes paralog calling and does not require evolutionary proximity to well annotated model organisms. We developed this pipeline for the ascidian Ciona intestinalis, a highly polymorphic member of the divergent sister group of the vertebrates, emerging as a powerful model organism to study chordate gene function, Gene Regulatory Networks and molecular mechanisms underlying human pathologies. Using this pipeline we have generated the first full-ORF collection for a highly polymorphic marine invertebrate. It contains 19,163 full-ORF cDNA clones covering 60{\%} of Ciona coding genes, and full-ORF orthologs for approximately half of curated human disease-associated genes.},

Phila. 13, 1], in particular, led to the idea that the developmental program of these animals was driven by the cell-autonomous inheritance of localised maternal determinants, rendered precise by the stereotyped pattern of invariant cell cleavages. Work in the past 20 years indeed identified several localised maternal determinants of the position of cleavage planes or of some early cell fates. The overwhelming majority of cells in the three germ layers, however, do not follow a cell-autonomous differentiation program. Instead, they respond to short-range signals, as described in this review. Careful analysis of cell-cell contacts suggests that a major function of the invariant position of cleavage plans, besides segregating competence factors, is to control the relative positions of inducing cells and those competent to respond. Surprisingly, while the cell lineage is very well conserved between the divergent species Halocynthia roretzi and Ciona intestinalis, the molecular nature of inducing signals can vary. The constraints on embryo anatomy thus appear stronger than those on the choice of individual regulatory molecules.},

abstract = {Developmental changes in the temporal and spatial regulation of gene expression drive the emergence of normal mature brain function, while disruptions in these processes underlie many neurodevelopmental abnormalities. To solidify our foundational knowledge of such changes in a primate brain with an extended period of postnatal maturation like in human, we investigated the whole-genome transcriptional profiles of rhesus monkey brains from birth to adulthood. We found that gene expression dynamics are largest from birth through infancy, after which gene expression profiles transition to a relatively stable state by young adulthood. Biological pathway enrichment analysis revealed that genes more highly expressed at birth are associated with cell adhesion and neuron differentiation, while genes more highly expressed in juveniles and adults are associated with cell death. Neocortex showed significantly greater differential expression over time than sub-cortical structures, and this trend likely reflects the protracted postnatal development of the cortex. Using network analysis, we identified 27 co-expression modules containing genes with highly correlated expression patterns that are associated with specific brain regions, ages, or both. In particular, one module with high expression in neonatal cortex and striatum that decreases during infancy and juvenile development was significantly enriched for autism spectrum disorder (ASD)-related genes. This network was enriched for genes associated with axon guidance and interneuron differentiation, consistent with a disruption in the formation of functional cortical circuitry in ASD.},

abstract = {Correct development of the vertebrate body plan requires the early definition of two asymmetric, perpendicular axes. The first axis is established during oocyte maturation, and the second is established by symmetry breaking shortly after fertilization. The physical processes generating the second asymmetric, or dorsal-ventral, axis are well understood, but the specific molecular determinants, presumed to be maternal gene products, are poorly characterized. Whilst enrichment of maternal mRNAs at the animal and vegetal poles in both the oocyte and the early embryo has been studied, little is known about the distribution of maternal mRNAs along either the dorsal-ventral or left-right axes during the early cleavage stages. Here we report an unbiased analysis of the distribution of maternal mRNA on all axes of the Xenopus tropicalis 8-cell stage embryo, based on sequencing of single blastomeres whose positions within the embryo are known. Analysis of pooled data from complete sets of blastomeres from four embryos has identified 908 mRNAs enriched in either the animal or vegetal blastomeres, of which 793 are not previously reported as enriched. In contrast, we find no evidence for asymmetric distribution along either the dorsal-ventral or left-right axes. We confirm that animal pole enrichment is on average distinctly lower than vegetal pole enrichment, and that considerable variation is found between reported enrichment levels in different studies. We use publicly available data to show that there is a significant association between genes with human disease annotation and enrichment at the animal pole. Mutations in the human ortholog of the most animally enriched novel gene, Slc35d1, are causative for Schneckenbecken dysplasia, and we show that a similar phenotype is produced by depletion of the orthologous protein in Xenopus embryos.},

abstract = {Genes vary in their likelihood to undergo adaptive evolution. The genomic factors that determine adaptability, however, remain poorly understood. Genes function in the context of molecular networks, with some occupying more important positions than others and thus being likely to be under stronger selective pressures. However, how positive selection distributes across the different parts of molecular networks is still not fully understood. Here, we inferred positive selection using comparative genomics and population genetics approaches through the comparison of 10 mammalian and 270 human genomes, respectively. In agreement with previous results, we found that genes with lower network centralities are more likely to evolve under positive selection (as inferred from divergence data). Surprisingly, polymorphism data yield results in the opposite direction than divergence data: Genes with higher centralities are more likely to have been targeted by recent positive selection during recent human evolution. Our results indicate that the relationship between centrality and the impact of adaptive evolution highly depends on the mode of positive selection and/or the evolutionary time-scale.},

abstract = {During development, functional structures must form with the correct three-dimensional geometry composed of the correct cell types. In many cases cell types are specified at locations distant to where they will ultimately reside for normal biological function. Although cell migration is crucial for normal development and morphogenesis of animal body plans and organ systems, abnormal cell migration during adult life underlies pathological states such as invasion and metastasis of cancer. In both contexts cells migrate either individually, as loosely associated sheets or as clusters of cells. In this review, we summarize, compare and integrate knowledge gained from several in vivo model systems that have yielded insights into the regulation of morphogenic cell migration, such as the zebrafish lateral line primordium and primordial germ cells, Drosophila border cell clusters, vertebrate neural crest migration and angiogenic sprouts in the post-natal mouse retina. Because of its broad multicontextual and multiphylletic distribution, understanding cell migration in its various manifestations in vivo is likely to provide new insights into both the function and malfunction of key embryonic and postembryonic events. In this review, we will provide a succinct phenotypic description of the many model systems utilized to study cell migration in vivo. More importantly, we will highlight, compare and integrate recent advances in our understanding of how cell migration is regulated in these varied model systems with special emphasis on individual and collective cell movements.},

Our understanding of ECM composition, structure and function has grown considerably in the last several decades and this knowledge has revealed that the extracellular microenvironment is critically important for cell growth, survival, differentiation and morphogenesis. ECM and the cellular receptors that interact with it mediate both physical linkages with the cytoskeleton and the bidirectional flow of information between the extracellular and intracellular compartments. This review considers the range of cell and tissue functions attributed to ECM molecules and summarizes recent findings specific to key developmental processes. The importance of ECM as a dynamic repository for growth factors is highlighted along with more recent studies implicating the 3-dimensional organization and physical properties of the ECM as it relates to cell signaling and the regulation of morphogenetic cell behaviors. Embryonic cell and tissue generated forces and mechanical signals arising from ECM adhesion represent emerging areas of interest in this field.},

Cell shape changes and tissue movements like these are at the core of many of the morphogenetic movements that shape animal form during development, driving processes such as gastrulation, tube formation, and neurulation. The mechanisms of such cell shape changes must integrate developmental patterning information in order to spatially and temporally control force production-issues that touch on fundamental aspects of both cell and developmental biology and on birth defects research. How does developmental patterning regulate force-producing mechanisms, and what roles do such mechanisms play in development? Work on apical constriction from multiple systems including Drosophila, Caenorhabditis elegans, sea urchin, Xenopus, chick, and mouse has begun to illuminate these issues. Here, we review this effort to explore the diversity of mechanisms of apical constriction, the diversity of roles that apical constriction plays in development, and the common themes that emerge from comparing systems.},

However, these experiments remain too difficult/expensive for many laboratories to apply comprehensively to their system of interest. Here, we explore the potential of elucidating regulatory systems in varied cell types using computational techniques that rely on only data of gene expression, low-resolution chromatin accessibility, and TF-DNA binding specificities ('motifs'). We show that static computational motif scans overlaid with chromatin accessibility data reasonably approximate experimentally measured TF-DNA binding. We demonstrate that predicted binding profiles and expression patterns of hundreds of TFs are sufficient to identify major regulators of ∼200 spatiotemporal expression domains in the Drosophila embryo. We are then able to learn reliable statistical models of enhancer activity for over 70 expression domains and apply those models to annotate domain specific enhancers genome-wide. Throughout this work, we apply our motif and accessibility based approach to comprehensively characterize the regulatory network of fruitfly embryonic development and show that the accuracy of our computational method compares favorably to approaches that rely on data from many experimental assays.},

abstract = {The spatiotemporal control of gene expression is crucial for the successful completion of animal development. The evolutionary constraints on development are particularly strong for the mid-embryonic stage when body segments are specified, as evidenced by a high degree of morphological and protein-coding gene conservation during this period--a phenomenon known as the developmental hourglass. The discovery of microRNA-mediated gene control revealed an entirely new layer of complexity of the molecular networks that orchestrate development. However, the constraints on microRNA developmental expression and evolution, and the implications for animal evolution are less well understood. To systematically explore the conservation of microRNAs during development, we carried out a genome-wide comparative study of microRNA expression levels throughout the ontogenesis of two divergent fruit flies, Drosophila melanogaster and D. virilis. We show that orthologous microRNAs display highly similar temporal profiles regardless of their mutation rates, suggesting that the timely expression of microRNA genes can be more constrained than their sequence. Furthermore, transitions between key developmental events in the different species are accompanied by conserved shifts in microRNA expression profiles, with the mid-embryonic period between gastrulation and segmentation characterized by the highest similarity of microRNA expression. The conservation of microRNA expression therefore displays an hourglass pattern similar to that observed for protein-coding genes.},

abstract = {The "developmental hourglass'' describes a pattern of increasing morphological divergence towards earlier and later embryonic development, separated by a period of significant conservation across distant species (the "phylotypic stage''). Recent studies have found evidence in support of the hourglass effect at the genomic level. For instance, the phylotypic stage expresses the oldest and most conserved transcriptomes. However, the regulatory mechanism that causes the hourglass pattern remains an open question. Here, we use an evolutionary model of regulatory gene interactions during development to identify the conditions under which the hourglass effect can emerge in a general setting. The model focuses on the hierarchical gene regulatory network that controls the developmental process, and on the evolution of a population under random perturbations in the structure of that network. The model predicts, under fairly general assumptions, the emergence of an hourglass pattern in the structure of a temporal representation of the underlying gene regulatory network. The evolutionary age of the corresponding genes also follows an hourglass pattern, with the oldest genes concentrated at the hourglass waist. The key behind the hourglass effect is that developmental regulators should have an increasingly specific function as development progresses. Analysis of developmental gene expression profiles from Drosophila melanogaster and Arabidopsis thaliana provide consistent results with our theoretical predictions.},

abstract = {The developmental hourglass model has been used to describe the morphological transitions of related species throughout embryogenesis. Recently, quantifiable approaches combining transcriptomic and evolutionary information provided novel evidence for the presence of a phylotranscriptomic hourglass pattern across kingdoms. As its biological function is unknown it remains speculative whether this pattern is functional or merely represents a nonfunctional evolutionary relic. The latter would seriously hamper future experimental approaches designed to test hypotheses regarding its function. Here, we address this question by generating transcriptome divergence index (TDI) profiles across embryogenesis of Danio rerio, Drosophila melanogaster, and Arabidopsis thaliana. To enable meaningful evaluation of the resulting patterns, we develop a statistical test that specifically assesses potential hourglass patterns. Based on this objective measure we find that two of these profiles follow a statistically significant hourglass pattern with the most conserved transcriptomes in the phylotypic periods. As the TDI considers only recent evolutionary signals, this indicates that the phylotranscriptomic hourglass pattern is not a rudiment but possibly actively maintained, implicating the existence of some linked biological function associated with embryogenesis in extant species.},

Vertebrate gene families are typically found in simplified form in Ciona, suggesting that ascidians contain the basic ancestral complement of genes involved in cell signaling and development.

Initially, the developmental fates of all blastomeres of the 64-cell stage embryo were examined, and thereafter, only the fates of daughter blastomeres of those blastomeres that were not tissue restricted at the 64-cell stage were traced. The developmental fates of blastomeres were highly invariant except for two candidates for "equivalence groups" (J. Kimble, J. Sulston, and J. White (1979). In "Cell Lineage, Stem Cells and Cell Determination," pp. 59-68. Elsevier, Amsterdam/New York), in which cellular interaction is suggested to be involved in the specification of the fates. The right and left a8.25 cells gave rise to the otolith and ocellus, and the right and left b8.17 cells gave rise to the spinal cord and endodermal strand in a complementary manner. No fixed relationship existed between the position of the blastomere and its derivative. Most restrictions of cell fates occurred early in cleavage. The numbers of blastomeres which generated a single type of tissue were 44 at the 64-cell stage and 94 at the 110-cell stage. Eight pairs of blastomeres had not yet become tissue restricted by the 110-cell stage. Almost complete lineages of epidermis, nervous system, muscle, mesenchyme, notochord, and endodermal tissues were described, and a fate map was constructed for the blastula. For certain tissues, the primordial cells occupied two different regions. Supplementary investigations of the lineage of muscle cells were also performed on embryos of another species, Ciona intestinalis.},

We show that for the measured parameter ranges, the Dpp gradient does not reach steady state during Drosophila wing development. We further show that both, pre-steady-state dynamics and advection of cell-bound ligand in a growing tissue can, in principle, enable scaling, even for non-uniform tissue growth. For the parameter values that have been established for the Dpp morphogen in the Drosophila wing imaginal disc, we show that scaling is mainly a result of the pre-steady-state dynamics. Pre-steady-state dynamics are pervasive in morphogen-controlled systems, thus making this a probable general mechanism for dynamic scaling of morphogen gradients in growing developmental systems.},

abstract = {The large spectrum of limb morphologies reflects the wide evolutionary diversification of the basic pentadactyl pattern in tetrapods. In even-toed ungulates (artiodactyls, including cattle), limbs are adapted for running as a consequence of progressive reduction of their distal skeleton to symmetrical and elongated middle digits with hoofed phalanges. Here we analyse bovine embryos to establish that polarized gene expression is progressively lost during limb development in comparison to the mouse. Notably, the transcriptional upregulation of the Ptch1 gene, which encodes a Sonic hedgehog (SHH) receptor, is disrupted specifically in the bovine limb bud mesenchyme. This is due to evolutionary alteration of a Ptch1 cis-regulatory module, which no longer responds to graded SHH signalling during bovine handplate development. Our study provides a molecular explanation for the loss of digit asymmetry in bovine limb buds and suggests that modifications affecting the Ptch1 cis-regulatory landscape have contributed to evolutionary diversification of artiodactyl limbs.},

abstract = {BMP signaling plays a crucial role in the establishment of the dorso-ventral body axis in bilaterally symmetric animals. However, the topologies of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling networks vary drastically in different animal groups, raising questions about the evolutionary constraints and evolvability of BMP signaling systems. Using loss-of-function analysis and mathematical modeling, we show that two signaling centers expressing different BMPs and BMP antagonists maintain the secondary axis of the sea anemone Nematostella. We demonstrate that BMP signaling is required for asymmetric Hox gene expression and mesentery formation. Computational analysis reveals that network parameters related to BMP4 and Chordin are constrained both in Nematostella and Xenopus, while those describing the BMP signaling modulators can vary significantly. Notably, only chordin, but not bmp4 expression needs to be spatially restricted for robust signaling gradient formation. Our data provide an explanation of the evolvability of BMP signaling systems in axis formation throughout Eumetazoa.},

At this level of complexity, mechanistic models of development become essential for integrating data, guiding future experiments, and predicting the effects of genetic and physical perturbations. However, the formulation and analysis of quantitative models of development are limited by high levels of uncertainty in experimental measurements, a large number of both known and unknown system components, and the multiscale nature of development. At the same time, an expanding arsenal of experimental tools can constrain models and directly test their predictions, making the modeling efforts not only necessary, but feasible. Using a number of problems in fruit fly development, we discuss how models can be used to test the feasibility of proposed patterning mechanisms and characterize their systems-level properties.},

abstract = {The concept of heterochrony derives from classical approaches to the study of ontogeny and phylogeny. Under the influence of landmark books by deBeer (1930) and Gould (1977), the traditional theories have been revised to fit into the conceptual framework of modern genetics and evolutionary theory. The current scheme, however, suffers from a problem of lack of precise definitions. The term heterochrony is now used to refer to a developmental process as well as to an evolutionary pattern. That is, it refers to a microevolutionary process of adaptation, operating in local populations under selection and to a macroevolutionary pattern based on undefined internal laws of form. Such conceptually contradictory frameworks are a source of confusion and of empirical misuse of concepts. We propose to reduce the dependence of current thinking about heterochrony on the concept of "timing" and instead focus on the organization of sequences of developmental events in ontogeny. Although Haeckelian views have been rejected, most experts would agree that some subtle parallelism between ontogeny and phylogeny does occur. This relationship deserves renewed attention and urodeles are particularly suited to study it due to their variable patterns of ontogeny and complex life cycles. Current reductionist attempts to apply the morphological terminology and postulates of classical heterochrony concepts to cellular and molecular (genetic) aspects of morphogenesis are problematic. Molecular heterochrony requires a linear or strictly hierarchical structure of gene regulation of development. In addition, isomorphism between genetic mutations and morphological changes would be required for the existing terminology to apply. Finally, we caution against a broad interpretation of heterochronic processes at the molecular level, since the approach may end up permitting the meaningless interpretation of any developmental change as heterochrony.},

abstract = {Hierarchy seems to pervade complexity in both living and artificial systems. Despite its relevance, no general theory that captures all features of hierarchy and its origins has been proposed yet. Here we present a formal approach resulting from the convergence of theoretical morphology and network theory that allows constructing a 3D morphospace of hierarchies and hence comparing the hierarchical organization of ecological, cellular, technological, and social networks. Embedded within large voids in the morphospace of all possible hierarchies, four major groups are identified. Two of them match the expected from random networks with similar connectivity, thus suggesting that nonadaptive factors are at work. Ecological and gene networks define the other two, indicating that their topological order is the result of functional constraints. These results are consistent with an exploration of the morphospace, using in silico evolved networks.},
annote = {SUMMARY:
--
They want to make a characterization of hierarchical networks, using 3 different measures:
"Treenes"," Feedforwardness" and "orderabiltity" that then use as the axes of a morphispace
-
-Treeness weights how pyramidal is the structure and how unambiguous is its chain of command

-feedforwardness as a measure that weights the impact of cyclic modules on the feedforward structure

-Orderability defined as the fraction of the nodes of the graph G that does not belong to any cycle.

----------------- DETAILS:
they use random networks and 125 real networks to analyze where in the morphospace they are located and found that they fall into 4 clusters of the morphospace, and most notably the real datasets are within the random networks.
-
then they demontrate that some voids of the morphospace can be reached by a searching algorithm, but the

--- CONCLUSION:

they conclude that the hierarchiecal order in nature or man-made networks are simply the most probable ones.



------ some comments:
they dont include functionality, or weighted nodes..
the axes are exclusive, you can not reach the extremes because you cannot have treeness = 1 and orderability = 0},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cell and tissue specific gene expression is a defining feature of embryonic development in multi-cellular organisms. However, the range of gene expression patterns, the extent of the correlation of expression with function, and the classes of genes whose spatial expression are tightly regulated have been unclear due to the lack of an unbiased, genome-wide survey of gene expression patterns.

RESULTS: We determined and documented embryonic expression patterns for 6,003 (44{\%}) of the 13,659 protein-coding genes identified in the Drosophila melanogaster genome with over 70,000 images and controlled vocabulary annotations. Individual expression patterns are extraordinarily diverse, but by supplementing qualitative in situ hybridization data with quantitative microarray time-course data using a hybrid clustering strategy, we identify groups of genes with similar expression. Of 4,496 genes with detectable expression in the embryo, 2,549 (57{\%}) fall into 10 clusters representing broad expression patterns. The remaining 1,947 (43{\%}) genes fall into 29 clusters representing restricted expression, 20{\%} patterned as early as blastoderm, with the majority restricted to differentiated cell types, such as epithelia, nervous system, or muscle. We investigate the relationship between expression clusters and known molecular and cellular-physiological functions.

CONCLUSION: Nearly 60{\%} of the genes with detectable expression exhibit broad patterns reflecting quantitative rather than qualitative differences between tissues. The other 40{\%} show tissue-restricted expression; the expression patterns of over 1,500 of these genes are documented here for the first time. Within each of these categories, we identified clusters of genes associated with particular cellular and developmental functions.},

abstract = {Arctic reindeer experience extreme changes in environmental light from continuous summer daylight to continuous winter darkness. Here, we show that they may have a unique mechanism to cope with winter darkness by changing the wavelength reflection from their tapetum lucidum (TL). In summer, it is golden with most light reflected back directly through the retina, whereas in winter it is deep blue with less light reflected out of the eye. The blue reflection in winter is associated with significantly increased retinal sensitivity compared with summer animals. The wavelength of reflection depends on TL collagen spacing, with reduced spacing resulting in shorter wavelengths, which we confirmed in summer and winter animals. Winter animals have significantly increased intra-ocular pressure, probably produced by permanent pupil dilation blocking ocular drainage. This may explain the collagen compression. The resulting shift to a blue reflection may scatter light through photoreceptors rather than directly reflecting it, resulting in elevated retinal sensitivity via increased photon capture. This is, to our knowledge, the first description of a retinal structural adaptation to seasonal changes in environmental light. Increased sensitivity occurs at the cost of reduced acuity, but may be an important adaptation in reindeer to detect moving predators in the dark Arctic winter.},

First, theoretical models of morphogenesis suggest several generalizations about how limb geometry is laid down during development. Comparative studies and experimental manipulations of developing limbs independently confirm these generalizations, which amount to a set of "construction rules" for determining how the major features of limb architecture are established in ontogeny. Armed with these rules, we can inquire how limb morphology can be varied during evolution and suggest a more precise operational definition of "developmental constraints" on morphological evolution.},

abstract = {The interplay of evolution and development has been at the heart of evolutionary theory for more than a century. Heterochrony—change in the timing or rate of developmental events—has been implicated in the evolution of major vertebrate lineages such as mammals, including humans. Birds are the most speciose land vertebrates, with more than 10,000 living species representing a bewildering array of ecologies. Their anatomy is radically different from that of other vertebrates. The unique bird skull houses two highly specialized systems: the sophisticated visual and neuromuscular coordination system allows flight coordination and exploitation of diverse visual landscapes, and the astonishing variations of the beak enable a wide range of avian lifestyles. Here we use a geometric morphometric approach integrating developmental, neontological and palaeontological data to show that the heterochronic process of paedomorphosis, by which descendants resemble the juveniles of their ancestors, is responsible for several major evolutionary transitions in the origin of birds. We analysed the variability of a series of landmarks on all known theropod dinosaur skull ontogenies as well as outgroups and birds. The first dimension of variability captured ontogeny, indicating a conserved ontogenetic trajectory. The second dimension accounted for phylogenetic change towards more bird-like dinosaurs. Basally branching eumaniraptorans and avialans clustered with embryos of other archosaurs, indicating paedomorphosis. Our results reveal at least four paedomorphic episodes in the history of birds combined with localized peramorphosis (development beyond the adult state of ancestors) in the beak. Paedomorphic enlargement of the eyes and associated brain regions parallels the enlargement of the nasal cavity and olfactory brain in mammals. This study can be a model for investigations of heterochrony in evolutionary transitions, illuminating the origin of adaptive features and inspiring studies of developmental mechanisms.},

abstract = {“Theoretical biology” is a surprisingly heterogeneous field, partly because it encompasses “doing theory” across disciplines as diverse as molecular biology, systematics, ecology, and evolutionary biology. Moreover, it is done in a stunning variety of different ways, using anything from formal analytical models to computer simulations, from graphic representations to verbal arguments. In this essay I survey a number of aspects of what it means to do theoretical biology, and how they compare with the allegedly much more restricted sense of theory in the physical sciences. I also tackle a recent trend toward the presentation of all-encompassing theories in the biological sciences, from general theories of ecology to a recent attempt to provide a conceptual framework for the entire set of biological disciplines. Finally, I discuss the roles played by philosophers of science in criticizing and shaping biological theorizing.},

abstract = {The vast majority of biologists engaged in evolutionary studies interpret virtually every aspect of biodiversity in adaptive terms. This narrow view of evolution has become untenable in light of recent observations from genomic sequencing and population-genetic theory. Numerous aspects of genomic architecture, gene structure, and developmental pathways are difficult to explain without invoking the nonadaptive forces of genetic drift and mutation. In addition, emergent biological features such as complexity, modularity, and evolvability, all of which are current targets of considerable speculation, may be nothing more than indirect by-products of processes operating at lower levels of organization. These issues are examined in the context of the view that the origins of many aspects of biological diversity, from gene-structural embellishments to novelties at the phenotypic level, have roots in nonadaptive processes, with the population-genetic environment imposing strong directionality on the paths that are open to evolutionary exploitation.},

abstract = {The observation that animal morphology tends to be conserved during the embryonic phylotypic period (a period of maximal similarity between the species within each animal phylum) led to the proposition that embryogenesis diverges more extensively early and late than in the middle, known as the hourglass model. This pattern of conservation is thought to reflect a major constraint on the evolution of animal body plans. Despite a wealth of morphological data confirming that there is often remarkable divergence in the early and late embryos of species from the same phylum, it is not yet known to what extent gene expression evolution, which has a central role in the elaboration of different animal forms, underpins the morphological hourglass pattern. Here we address this question using species-specific microarrays designed from six sequenced Drosophila species separated by up to 40 million years. We quantify divergence at different times during embryogenesis, and show that expression is maximally conserved during the arthropod phylotypic period. By fitting different evolutionary models to each gene, we show that at each time point more than 80{\%} of genes fit best to models incorporating stabilizing selection, and that for genes whose evolutionarily optimal expression level is the same across all species, selective constraint is maximized during the phylotypic period. The genes that conform most to the hourglass pattern are involved in key developmental processes. These results indicate that natural selection acts to conserve patterns of gene expression during mid-embryogenesis, and provide a genome-wide insight into the molecular basis of the hourglass pattern of developmental evolution.},

abstract = {Parallels between phylogeny and ontogeny have been discussed for almost two centuries, and a number of theories have been proposed to explain such patterns. Especially elusive is the phylotypic stage, a phase during development where species within a phylum are particularly similar to each other. Although this has formerly been interpreted as a recapitulation of phylogeny, it is now thought to reflect an ontogenetic progression phase, where strong constraints on developmental regulation and gene interactions exist. Several studies have shown that genes expressed during this stage evolve at a slower rate, but it has so far not been possible to derive an unequivocal molecular signature associated with this stage. Here we use a combination of phylostratigraphy and stage-specific gene expression data to generate a cumulative index that reflects the evolutionary age of the transcriptome at given ontogenetic stages. Using zebrafish ontogeny and adult development as a model, we find that the phylotypic stage does indeed express the oldest transcriptome set and that younger sets are expressed during early and late development, thus faithfully mirroring the hourglass model of morphological divergence. Reproductively active animals show the youngest transcriptome, with major differences between males and females. Notably, ageing animals express increasingly older genes. Comparisons with similar data sets from flies and nematodes show that this pattern occurs across phyla. Our results indicate that an old transcriptome marks the phylotypic phase and that phylogenetic differences at other ontogenetic stages correlate with the expression of newly evolved genes.},

abstract = {Urochordates (ascidians) have recently supplanted cephalochordates (amphioxus) as the extant sister taxon of vertebrates. Given that urochordates possess migratory cells that have been classified as 'neural crest-like'- and that cephalochordates lack such cells--this phylogenetic hypothesis may have significant implications with respect to the origin of the neural crest and neural crest-derived skeletal tissues in vertebrates. We present an overview of the genes and gene regulatory network associated with specification of the neural crest in vertebrates. We then use these molecular data--alongside cell behaviour, cell fate and embryonic context--to assess putative antecedents (latent homologues) of the neural crest or neural crest cells in ascidians and cephalochordates. Ascidian migratory mesenchymal cells--non-pigment-forming trunk lateral line cells and pigment-forming 'neural crest-like cells' (NCLC)--are unlikely latent neural crest cell homologues. Rather, Snail-expressing cells at the neural plate of border of urochordates and cephalochordates likely represent the extent of neural crest elaboration in non-vertebrate chordates. We also review evidence for the evolutionary origin of two neural crest-derived skeletal tissues--cartilage and dentine. Dentine is a bona fide vertebrate novelty, and dentine-secreting odontoblasts represent a cell type that is exclusively derived from the neural crest. Cartilage, on the other hand, likely has a much deeper origin within the Metazoa. The mesodermally derived cellular cartilages of some protostome invertebrates are much more similar to vertebrate cartilage than is the acellular 'cartilage-like' tissue in cephalochordate pharyngeal arches. Cartilage, therefore, is not a vertebrate novelty, and a well-developed chondrogenic program was most likely co-opted from mesoderm to the neural crest along the vertebrate stem. We conclude that the neural crest is a vertebrate novelty, but that neural crest cells and their derivatives evolved and diversified in a step-wise fashion--first by elaboration of neural plate border cells, then by the innovation or co-option of new or ancient metazoan cell fates.},

abstract = {The relative positions of the brain and mouth are of central importance for models of chordate evolution. The dorsal hollow neural tube and the mouth have often been thought of as developmentally distinct structures that may have followed independent evolutionary paths. In most chordates however, including vertebrates and ascidians, the mouth primordia have been shown to fate to the anterior neural boundary. In ascidians such as Ciona there is a particularly intimate relationship between brain and mouth development, with a thin canal connecting the neural tube lumen to the mouth primordium at larval stages. This so-called neurohypophyseal canal was previously thought to be a secondary connection that formed relatively late, after the independent formation of the mouth primordium and the neural tube. Here we show that the Ciona neurohypophyseal canal is present from the end of neurulation and represents the anteriormost neural tube, and that the future mouth opening is actually derived from the anterior neuropore. The mouth thus forms at the anterior midline transition between neural tube and surface ectoderm. In the vertebrate Xenopus, we find that although the mouth primordium is not topologically continuous with the neural tube lumen, it nonetheless forms at this same transition point. This close association between the mouth primordium and the anterior neural tube in both ascidians and amphibians suggests that the evolution of these two structures may be more closely linked than previously appreciated. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

General hypotheses for tissue separation based on differential adhesion or tension have been proposed in the past, but with little experimental support. During the last decade, the field has experienced a strong revival, largely driven by renewed interest in biophysical modeling of development. Here, I will discuss the various models of boundary formation and summarize recent studies that have shifted our understanding of the process from the simple juxtaposition of global tissue properties to the characterization of local cellular reactions. Current evidence favors a model whereby separation is controlled by cell surface cues, which, upon cell-cell contact, generate acute changes in cytoskeletal and adhesive properties to inhibit cell mixing, and whereby the integration of multiple local cues may dictate both the global morphogenetic properties of a tissue and its separation from adjacent cell populations.},

To define the cellular changes necessary for remodeling, we performed live confocal imaging of cultured mouse embryos during vessel remodeling. Our data revealed that vessel diameter increase occurs via two distinct processes that are dependent on normal blood flow: vessel fusions and directed endothelial cell migrations. Vessel fusions resulted in a rapid change in vessel diameter and were restricted to regions that experience the highest flow near the vitelline artery and vein. Directed cell migrations induced by blood flow resulted in the recruitment of endothelial cells to larger vessels from smaller capillaries and were observed in larger artery segments as they expanded. The dynamic and specific endothelial cell behaviors captured in this study reveal how sensitive endothelial cells are to changes in blood flow and how such responses drive vascular remodeling.},

Although this process is a major generator of biodiversity, its genetic basis is still poorly understood. Here we investigate the genetic architecture of niche differentiation in a sympatric species pair of threespine stickleback fish by mapping the environment-dependent effects of phenotypic traits on hybrid feeding and performance under semi-natural conditions. We show that multiple, unlinked loci act largely additively to determine position along the major niche axis separating these recently diverged species. We also find that functional mismatch between phenotypic traits reduces the growth of some stickleback hybrids beyond that expected from an intermediate phenotype, suggesting a role for epistasis between the underlying genes. This functional mismatch might lead to hybrid incompatibilities that are analogous to those underlying intrinsic reproductive isolation but depend on the ecological context.},

abstract = {Gelatinous zooplankton populations are well known for their ability to take over perturbed ecosystems. The ability of these animals to outcompete and functionally replace fish that exhibit an effective visual predatory mode is counterintuitive because jellyfish are described as inefficient swimmers that must rely on direct contact with prey to feed. We show that jellyfish exhibit a unique mechanism of passive energy recapture, which is exploited to allow them to travel 30{\%} further each swimming cycle, thereby reducing metabolic energy demand by swimming muscles. By accounting for large interspecific differences in net metabolic rates, we demonstrate, contrary to prevailing views, that the jellyfish (Aurelia aurita) is one of the most energetically efficient propulsors on the planet, exhibiting a cost of transport (joules per kilogram per meter) lower than other metazoans. We estimate that reduced metabolic demand by passive energy recapture improves the cost of transport by 48{\%}, allowing jellyfish to achieve the large sizes required for sufficient prey encounters. Pressure calculations, using both computational fluid dynamics and a newly developed method from empirical velocity field measurements, demonstrate that this extra thrust results from positive pressure created by a vortex ring underneath the bell during the refilling phase of swimming. These results demonstrate a physical basis for the ecological success of medusan swimmers despite their simple body plan. Results from this study also have implications for bioinspired design, where low-energy propulsion is required.},

This was one the most significant attempts to define the principles that connected morphological complexity and embryonic development. Understanding this relation is central to both evolutionary biology and developmental genetics. Von Baer's ideas have been both a source of inspiration to generations of biologists and a target of continuous criticism over many years. With advances in multiple fields, including paleontology, cladistics, phylogenetics, genomics, and cell and developmental biology, it is now possible to examine carefully the significance of von Baer's law and its predictions. In this review, I argue that, 185 years after von Baer's law was first formulated, its main concepts after proper refurbishing remain surprisingly relevant in revealing the fundamentals of the evolution-development connection, and suggest that their explanation should become the focus of renewed research. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

A. Davidson, M. A. R. Koehl, R. Keller, and G. F. Oster (1995) Development 121, 2005-2018]. Here, we measured the composite elastic modulus of the cellular and extracellular matrix layers in the blastula wall of Strongylocentrotus purpuratus embryos at the mesenchyme blastula stage. Combined, these two layers exhibit a viscoelastic response with an initial stiffness ranging from 600 to 2300 Pa. To identify the cellular structures responsible for this stiffness we disrupted these structures and correlated the resulting lesions to changes in the elastic modulus. We treated embryos with cytochalasin D to disrupt the actin-based cytoskeleton, nocodazole to disrupt the microtubule-based cytoskeleton, and a gentle glycine extraction to disrupt the apical extracellular matrix (ECM). Embryos treated less than 60 min in cytochalasin D showed no change in their time-dependent elastic modulus even though F-actin was severely disrupted. Similarly, nocodazole had no effect on the elastic modulus even as the microtubules were severely disrupted. However, glycine extraction resulted in a 40 to 50{\%} decrease in the elastic modulus along with a dramatic reduction in the hyalin protein at the apical ECM, thus implicating the apical ECM as a major mechanical component of the blastula wall. This finding bears on the mechanical plausibility of several models for primary invagination.},

abstract = {Studies of the evolution of phenotypic diversity have gained mo- mentum among neontologists interested in the uneven distribution of diversity across the tree of life. Potential morphological diversity in a lineage is a function of the number of independent parameters required to describe the form, and innovations such as structural duplication and functional decoupling can enhance the potential for diversity in a given clade. The functional properties of organisms are determined by underlying parts, but any property that is determined by three or more parts expresses many-to-one mapping of form to function, in which many morphologies will have the same functional property. This ubiquitous feature of organismal design results in sur- faces of morphological variation that are neutral with respect to the functional property, and enhances the potential for simultaneously optimizing two or more functions of the system},

In France this dichotomy was represented by the 1830-1832 public debate between Geoffroy St.-Hilaire (form) and Cuvier (function). Geoffroy's aim was to establish links of homology (known to him as "analogies") between the four "embranchements" into which Cuvier had divided the animal kingdom. Despite the fanciful nature of some of his homologies, Geoffroy, who was guided by his "principe de connections," set in motion a school of morphology, some of whose conclusions, notably the homology of the dorsal surface of segmented invertebrates with the ventral surface of vertebrates, has been corroborated by recent studies in developmental genetics.},

Here we describe a novel thermodynamic model that computes expression patterns as a function of cis-regulatory sequence and of the binding-site preferences and expression of participating transcription factors. We apply this model to the segmentation gene network of Drosophila melanogaster and find that it predicts expression patterns of cis-regulatory modules with remarkable accuracy, demonstrating that positional information is encoded in the regulatory sequence and input factor distribution. Our analysis reveals that both strong and weaker binding sites contribute, leading to high occupancy of the module DNA, and conferring robustness against mutation; short-range homotypic clustering of weaker sites facilitates cooperative binding, which is necessary to sharpen the patterns. Our computational framework is generally applicable to most protein-DNA interaction systems.},

The game comes equipped with two decks of cards: one with 32 aces, 16 kings, and four queens and the other a conventional deck. The rules are these. Some external agency grants you funds sufficient to play a few hands. A machine deals the cards, choosing one or the other deck from which you will be dealt all hands. The cards are dealt in accord with an algorithm that reads a code emblazoned on the back of each card in infrared dye. When a card is dealt, the machine plays an annoying little tune of a few bars in length. Whoever gets a full house or better before his funds disappear wins a renewal of funds sufficient to play a few more hands. This game is about discovering generality in biology. How so? Let's give the face values on the cards biological interpretations. An ace represents genes and molecules underlying biosynthetic pathways of great antiquity, the kings mechanisms of transcription and translation, the queens regulatory or signaling molecules. The cards comprising the stacked deck correspond to events that arose early in the history of life. The conventional deck, with its deuces and treys, represent taxon-specific biological features, say, the morphologies of antelope horns, the variety of social insect castes, or the polyp polymorphisms of siphonophores.

By applying conservative filtering criteria and requiring 'sharp' transcript changes, we identified 1534 maternal genes, 792 transient zygotic genes, and 1053 genes whose transcript levels increase during embryogenesis. Each of these three categories is dominated by groups of genes where all transcript levels increase and/or decrease at similar times, suggesting a common mode of regulation. For example, 34{\%} of the transiently expressed genes fall into three groups, with increased transcript levels between 2.5-12, 11-20, and 15-20 h of development, respectively. We highlight common and distinctive functional features of these expression groups and identify a coupling between downregulation of transcript levels and targeted protein degradation.

Here, the development of a chiral pattern of actomyosin was revealed by studying actin cytoskeleton self-organization in cells with isotropic circular shape. A radially symmetrical system of actin bundles consisting of $\alpha$-actinin-enriched radial fibres (RFs) and myosin-IIA-enriched transverse fibres (TFs) evolved spontaneously into the chiral system as a result of the unidirectional tilting of all RFs, which was accompanied by a tangential shift in the retrograde movement of TFs. We showed that myosin-IIA-dependent contractile stresses within TFs drive their movement along RFs, which grow centripetally in a formin-dependent fashion. The handedness of the chiral pattern was shown to be regulated by $\alpha$-actinin-1. Computational modelling demonstrated that the dynamics of the RF-TF system can explain the pattern transition from radial to chiral. Thus, actin cytoskeleton self-organization provides built-in machinery that potentially allows cells to develop left-right asymmetry.},

Typically, segments form sequentially in what has been thought to be a regular process, relying on a segmentation clock to pattern budding segments and posterior mitosis to generate axial elongation. Here we show that segmentation in Tribolium has phases of variable periodicity during which segments are added at different rates. Furthermore, elongation during a period of rapid posterior segment addition is driven by high rates of cell rearrangement, demonstrated by differential fates of marked anterior and posterior blastoderm cells. A computational model of this period successfully reproduces elongation through cell rearrangement in the absence of cell division. Unlike current models of steady-state sequential segmentation and elongation from a proliferative growth zone, our results indicate that cell behaviours are dynamic and variable, corresponding to differences in segmentation rate and giving rise to morphologically distinct regions of the embryo.},

We show that collective cellular responses to selective perturbations of the intercellular adhesome conform to three mechanical phenotypes. These phenotypes are controlled by different molecular modules and characterized by distinct relationships between cellular kinematics and intercellular forces. We show that these forces and their rates can be predicted by the concentrations of cadherins and catenins. Unexpectedly, we identified different mechanical roles for P-cadherin and E-cadherin; whereas P-cadherin predicts levels of intercellular force, E-cadherin predicts the rate at which intercellular force builds up.},

abstract = {Birds and mammals, phylogenetically close amniotes with similar post-gastrula development, exhibit little conservation in their post-fertilization cleavage patterns. Data from the mouse suggest that cellular morphogenesis and molecular signaling at the cleavage stage play important roles in lineage specification at later (blastula and gastrula) stages. Very little is known, however, about cleavage-stage chick embryos, owing to their poor accessibility. This period of chick development takes place before egg-laying and encompasses several fundamental processes of avian embryology, including zygotic gene activation (ZGA) and blastoderm cell-layer increase. We have carried out morphological and cellular analyses of cleavage-stage chick embryos covering the first half of pre-ovipositional development, from Eyal-Giladi and Kochav stage (EGK-) I to EGK-V. Scanning electron microscopy revealed remarkable subcellular details of blastomere cellularization and subgerminal cavity formation. Phosphorylated RNA polymerase II immunostaining showed that ZGA in the chick starts at early EGK-III during the 7th to 8th nuclear division cycle, comparable with the time reported for other yolk-rich vertebrates (e.g. zebrafish and Xenopus). The increase in the number of cell layers after EGK-III is not a direct consequence of oriented cell division. Finally, we present evidence that, as in the zebrafish embryo, a yolk syncytial layer is formed in the avian embryo after EGK-V. Our data suggest that several fundamental features of cleavage-stage development in birds resemble those in yolk-rich anamniote species, revealing conservation in vertebrate early development. Whether this conservation lends morphogenetic support to the anamniote-to-amniote transition in evolution or reflects developmental plasticity in convergent evolution awaits further investigation.},

they dont explain (or critique) that PI is patterning the early embyo, because the bicoid-gap network is a dynamic one, not a "pure" PI system in which the gradient (information) and the cell interpretation to that gradient are independent
he doesnt discuss the fact that the simpler PI theory dont really explain how the pattern is form, because the pattern explication is just translated to the "interpretation" part, which remains obscure.

They oversimplify the drosophila early development. it says that the gap network is not an iteration of a self organizing pattern. This has been proved wrong.

they propose 3 ways i n which PI and RD can combine:

Mode 1: RD acting upstream of PI
i think this is a trivial combination of both mechanisms. no real examples

Mode 2: RD acting in parallel with PI
they give the example of SHH gradient (PI) and RD acting "simultaneously but independently" 
in this case, the RD system is making most of the patterning, as determines what is finger and what is not. The PI just gives the identity (changing some proliferation rate) to the fingers. 
I found misleading the paragraph "the creation of a complete hand requires each cell to correctly make both decisions independently.." is not clear what they mean with complete hand.. without the SHH gradient a hand with n fingers is formed, the difference is that the digits are the same. so the "Wildtype" hand is not formed, but is still a complete hand.

RD acting downstream of PI-
In here, they use as an example their own work with the limb, in which they found that the digits (set by RD) are subject to a gradient in the proximo-distal axis, which change the wavelength of the RD.
They say that this suggests that RD is controled (and thus, downstrean) of a PI system.I think this is an oversimplification an a misleading use of "downstream", as in genetics normaly you say that a gene is downstream of another when the later is only active when the former is also.
This is clearly not the case, because the PI only "modulates" the RD and affects the final pattern. the same could be said by the limb bud size or shape as the change in these can affect also the final pattern.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Non-sequence gene data (images, literature, etc.) can be found in many different public databases. Access to these data is mostly by text based methods using gene names; however, gene annotation is neither complete, nor fully systematic between organisms, and is also not generally stable over time. This provides some challenges for text based access, especially for cross-species searches. We propose a method for non-sequence data retrieval based on sequence similarity, which removes dependence on annotation and text searches. This work was motivated by the need to provide better access to large numbers of in situ images, and the observation that such image data were usually associated with a specific gene sequence. Sequence similarity searches are found in existing gene oriented databases, but mostly give indirect access to non-sequence data via navigational links.

RESULTS: Three applications were built to explore the proposed method: accessing image data, literature and gene names. Searches are initiated with the sequence of the user's gene of interest, which is searched against a database of sequences associated with the target data. The matching (non-sequence) target data are returned directly to the user's browser, organised by sequence similarity. The method worked well for the intended application in image data management. Comparison with text based searches of the image data set showed the accuracy of the method. Applied to literature searches it facilitated retrieval of mostly high relevance references. Applied to gene name data it provided a useful analysis of name variation of related genes within and between species.

CONCLUSION: This method makes a powerful and useful addition to existing methods for searching gene data based on text retrieval or curated gene lists. In particular the method facilitates cross-species comparisons, and enables the handling of novel or otherwise un-annotated genes. Applications using the method are quick and easy to build, and the data require little maintenance. This approach largely circumvents the need for annotation, which can be a major obstacle to the development of genomic scale data resources.},

abstract = {The Xenopus embryo has provided key insights into fate specification, the cell cycle, and other fundamental developmental and cellular processes, yet a comprehensive understanding of its transcriptome is lacking. Here, we used paired end RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to explore the transcriptome of Xenopus tropicalis in 23 distinct developmental stages. We determined expression levels of all genes annotated in RefSeq and Ensembl and showed for the first time on a genome-wide scale that, despite a general state of transcriptional silence in the earliest stages of development, approximately 150 genes are transcribed prior to the midblastula transition. In addition, our splicing analysis uncovered more than 10,000 novel splice junctions at each stage and revealed that many known genes have additional unannotated isoforms. Furthermore, we used Cufflinks to reconstruct transcripts from our RNA-seq data and found that ∼13.5{\%} of the final contigs are derived from novel transcribed regions, both within introns and in intergenic regions. We then developed a filtering pipeline to separate protein-coding transcripts from noncoding RNAs and identified a confident set of 6686 noncoding transcripts in 3859 genomic loci. Since the current reference genome, XenTro3, consists of hundreds of scaffolds instead of full chromosomes, we also performed de novo reconstruction of the transcriptome using Trinity and uncovered hundreds of transcripts that are missing from the genome. Collectively, our data will not only aid in completing the assembly of the Xenopus tropicalis genome but will also serve as a valuable resource for gene discovery and for unraveling the fundamental mechanisms of vertebrate embryogenesis.},

The latter is mediated by a subset of phosphatases with dual specificity (VH-1 family). Here, we describe a new member of this family encoded by the puckered gene of Drosophila. Mutations in this gene lead to cytoskeletal defects that result in a failure in dorsal closure related to those associated with mutations in basket, the Drosophila JNK homolog. We show that puckered mutations result in the hyperactivation of DJNK, and that overexpression of puc mimics basket mutant phenotypes. We also show that puckered expression is itself a consequence of the activity of the JNK pathway and that during dorsal closure, JNK signaling has a dual role: to activate an effector, encoded by decapentaplegic, and an element of negative feedback regulation encoded by puckered.},

abstract = {The short gastrulation (sog) gene is expressed in broad lateral stripes comprising the neuroectoderm of the Drosophila blastoderm embryo. sog encodes a predicted secreted protein that functions nonautonomously to antagonize the activity of the TGF-beta-like Decapentaplegic (Dpp) signaling pathway in the dorsal region of the embryo. Recently, it has been shown that sog and dpp are functionally equivalent to their respective Xenopus homologs chordin and BMP-4. In this report we provide the first direct evidence that sog plays a local role in the lateral region of the blastoderm embryo to oppose Dpp activity in the neuroectoderm. In the dorsal region, Dpp signaling both suppresses neurogenesis and maintains expression of genes that promote dorsal cell fates (dorsalization). We show that Dpp also can perform both of these functions in the neuroectoderm. In wild-type embryos, the ability of Dpp to induce expression of dorsal markers including itself (autoactivation) in the neuroectoderm is blocked by sog. We propose that Sog protects the neuroectoderm from an invasive positive feedback loop created by Dpp diffusion and autoactivation. We show that the two functions of Dpp signaling, neural suppression and dorsalization, are triggered by distinct thresholds of Dpp activity. Epistasis experiments reveal that all observed sog activity can be accounted for by Sog functioning as a dedicated Dpp antagonist. Finally, we provide evidence that Sog functions as a diffusible morphogen in the blastoderm embryo. These data strongly support the view that the primary phylogenetically conserved function of the Drosophila sog and dpp genes and the homologous Xenopus chordin and BMP-4 genes is to subdivide the primitive embryonic ectoderm into neural versus non-neural domains.},

abstract = {The tempo at which a protein evolves depends not only on the rate at which mutations arise but also on the selective effects that those mutations have at the organismal level. It is intuitive that proteins functioning during different stages of development may be predisposed to having mutations of different selective effects. For example, it has been hypothesized that changes to proteins expressed during early development should have larger phenotypic consequences because later stages depend on them. Conversely, changes to proteins expressed much later in development should have smaller consequences at the organismal level. Here we assess whether proteins expressed at different times during Drosophila development vary systematically in their rates of evolution. We find that proteins expressed early in development and particularly during mid-late embryonic development evolve unusually slowly. In addition, proteins expressed in adult males show an elevated evolutionary rate. These two trends are independent of each other and cannot be explained by peculiar rates of mutation or levels of codon bias. Moreover, the observed patterns appear to hold across several functional classes of genes, although the exact developmental time of the slowest protein evolution differs among each class. We discuss our results in connection with data on the evolution of development.},

abstract = {Constraints in embryonic development are thought to bias the direction of evolution by making some changes less likely, and others more likely, depending on their consequences on ontogeny. Here, we characterize the constraints acting on genome evolution in vertebrates. We used gene expression data from two vertebrates: zebrafish, using a microarray experiment spanning 14 stages of development, and mouse, using EST counts for 26 stages of development. We show that, in both species, genes expressed early in development (1) have a more dramatic effect of knock-out or mutation and (2) are more likely to revert to single copy after whole genome duplication, relative to genes expressed late. This supports high constraints on early stages of vertebrate development, making them less open to innovations (gene gain or gene loss). Results are robust to different sources of data -- gene expression from microarrays, ESTs, or in situ hybridizations; and mutants from directed KO, transgenic insertions, point mutations, or morpholinos. We determine the pattern of these constraints, which differs from the model used to describe vertebrate morphological conservation ("hourglass" model). While morphological constraints reach a maximum at mid-development (the "phylotypic" stage), genomic constraints appear to decrease in a monotonous manner over developmental time.},

abstract = {Developmental constraints have been postulated to limit the space of feasible phenotypes and thus shape animal evolution. These constraints have been suggested to be the strongest during either early or mid-embryogenesis, which corresponds to the early conservation model or the hourglass model, respectively. Conflicting results have been reported, but in recent studies of animal transcriptomes the hourglass model has been favored. Studies usually report descriptive statistics calculated for all genes over all developmental time points. This introduces dependencies between the sets of compared genes and may lead to biased results. Here we overcome this problem using an alternative modular analysis. We used the Iterative Signature Algorithm to identify distinct modules of genes co-expressed specifically in consecutive stages of zebrafish development. We then performed a detailed comparison of several gene properties between modules, allowing for a less biased and more powerful analysis. Notably, our analysis corroborated the hourglass pattern at the regulatory level, with sequences of regulatory regions being most conserved for genes expressed in mid-development but not at the level of gene sequence, age, or expression, in contrast to some previous studies. The early conservation model was supported with gene duplication and birth that were the most rare for genes expressed in early development. Finally, for all gene properties, we observed the least conservation for genes expressed in late development or adult, consistent with both models. Overall, with the modular approach, we showed that different levels of molecular evolution follow different patterns of developmental constraints. Thus both models are valid, but with respect to different genomic features.},

"results were consistent with the study by Roux and Robinson-Rechavi [17], who also reported equally low values during the entire zebrafish embryogenesis, and a small increase in mid-larva, juvenile and adult. In contrast, Hazkani-Covo et al. [10] reported an hourglass pattern for protein distance between mouse and human genes expressed during development."




The oldest genes which belong to the Fungi/Metazoa class were overrepresented in the gastrula module (36.7{\%} of genes in the module vs. 25.7{\%} of all genes). The younger Bilateria genes were overrepresented in the phylotypic modules.




In contrast, Domazet-Lo{\v{s}}o and Tautz reported that genes expressed in early and late development tend to be younger than genes expressed in mid-development, supporting the hourglass model. Yet, that result does not hold for log-transformed gene expression levels, and is not recovered with measures of gene age other than the transcriptome age index.},

First, we test the prediction that the phylotypic stage is much more vulnerable than any other stage. A search of the teratological literature shows that disturbances at this stage lead to a much higher mortality than in other stages, in accordance with the prediction. Second, we test whether that vulnerability is indeed caused by the interactiveness and lack of modularity of the inductions or, alternatively, is caused by some particularly vulnerable process going on at that time. From the pattern of multiple induced anomalies we conclude that it is indeed the interactiveness that is the root cause of the vulnerability. Together these results support the hypotheses of Sander and Raff. We end by presenting an argument on why the absence of modularity in the inductive interactions may also be the root cause of the conservation of the much discussed temporal and spatial colinearity of the Hox genes.

abstract = {A central goal of evolutionary developmental biology (Evo-Devo) is to synthesize comparative molecular developmental genetics and its description of the dynamic relationship between genotype and phenotype with the microevolutionary processes (mutation, random drift, and selection) of population genetics. To this end, we analyzed sequence variation of five gene classes that act sequentially to shape early embryo development in Drosophila: maternal, gap, pair-rule, segment polarity, and segment identity genes. We found two related patterns: (1) a microevolutionary pattern, wherein relative sequence variation within species is 2- to 3-fold higher for maternal-effect genes than for any other gene class; and, (2) a macroevolutionary pattern, wherein the relative sequence divergence among species for maternal-effect genes is 2- to 4-fold greater than for any other gene class. Both patterns are qualitatively and quantitatively consistent with the predictions of microevolutionary theory. Our findings connect within-species genetic variation to between-species divergence and shed light on the controversy over the existence of a "developmental hourglass," where mid-embryonic stages are more evolutionarily constrained than either earlier or later stages. Because maternal-effect genes experience relaxed selective constraint relative to zygotic-effect genes, they explore a wider mutational and phenotypic space. As a result, early acting maternal-effect genes diverge more widely across taxa and thereby broaden the base of the developmental hourglass. In contrast, later acting zygotic genes are relatively more constrained and limited in their diversification across taxa, narrowing the waist of the developmental hourglass. This pattern is obscured by genes with both maternal and zygotic expression, which experience the strongest evolutionary constraint.},

abstract = {During development vertebrate embryos pass through a stage where their morphology is most conserved between species, the phylotypic period (approximately the pharyngula). To explain the resistance to evolutionary changes of this period, one hypothesis suggests that it is characterized by a high level of interactions. Based on this hypothesis, we examined protein-protein interactions, signal transduction cascades and miRNAs over the course of zebrafish development, and the conservation of expression of these genes in mouse development. We also investigated the characteristics of genes highly expressed before or during the presumed phylotypic period. We show that while there is a high diversity of interactions during the phylotypic period (protein-DNA, RNA-RNA, cell-cell, and between tissues), which is well conserved with mouse, there is no clear difference with later, more morphologically divergent, stages. We propose that the phylotypic period may rather be the expression at the morphological level of strong conservation of molecular processes earlier in development.},

they take all the genes expressed regardless of where they have expression, so the fact that two genes are present in the same stage, doesnt necessarily mean that they are interacting as they could be in different parts

-they dont normalize the number of genes, so they get contradictory results, like they found that the phylotypic stage is enriched with signaling genes (more than expected from random) but they say that the total number of signaling genes is greater in the larva. so is not clear if there are simply more genes expressed in the larva in general.

-they only mention the interdepence of signalling wiithout testing it..

-they propose that the conserved morphology is the consequence of conservation of earlier molecular conservation. When the morphology itself was considered to have a causal role (by multiple interactions between the tissues)},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Karl Ernst Von Baer noted that species tend to show greater morphological divergence in later stages of development when compared to earlier stages. Darwin originally interpreted these observations via a selectionist framework, suggesting that divergence should be greatest during ontogenic stages in which organisms experienced varying 'conditions of existence' and opportunity for differential selection. Modern hypotheses have focused on the notion that genes and structures involved in early development will be under stronger purifying selection due to the deleterious pleiotropic effects of mutations propagating over the course of ontogeny, also known as the developmental constraint hypothesis.

RESULTS: Using developmental stage-specific expressed sequence tag (EST) libraries, we tested the 2 hypotheses by comparing the rates of evolution of 7,180 genes obtained from 6 species of the Drosophila melanogaster group with respect to ontogeny, and sex and reproduction-related functions in gonadal tissues. Supporting morphological observations, we found evidence of a pattern of increasing mean evolutionary rate in genes that are expressed in subsequent stages of development. Furthermore, supporting expectations that early expressed genes are constrained in divergence, we found that embryo stage genes are involved in a higher mean number of interactions as compared to later stages. We noted that the accelerated divergence of genes in the adult stage is explained by those expressed specifically in the male gonads, whose divergence is driven by positive selection. In addition, accelerated gonadal gene divergence occurs only in the adult stage, suggesting that the effects of selection are observed primarily at the stages during which they are expected occur. Finally, we also found a significant correlation between temporal specificity of gene expression and evolutionary rate, supporting expectations that genes with ubiquitous expression are under stronger constraint.

CONCLUSION: Taken together, these results support both the developmental constraint hypothesis limiting the divergence of early expressed developmentally important genes, leading to a gradient of divergence rates over ontogeny (embryonic {\textless} larval/pupal {\textless} adult), as well as Darwin's 'selection opportunity' hypothesis leading to increased divergence in adults, particularly in the case of reproductive tissues. We suggest that a constraint early/opportunity late model best explains divergence over ontogeny.},

abstract = {In 1828, Karl von Baer proposed a set of four evolutionary "laws" pertaining to embryological development. According to von Baer's third law, young embryos from different species are relatively undifferentiated and resemble one another but as development proceeds, distinguishing features of the species begin to appear and embryos of different species progressively diverge from one another. An expansion of this law, called "the hourglass model," has been proposed independently by Denis Duboule and Rudolf Raff in the 1990s. According to the hourglass model, ontogeny is characterized by a starting point at which different taxa differ markedly from one another, followed by a stage of reduced intertaxonomic variability (the phylotypic stage), and ending in a von-Baer-like progressive divergence among the taxa. A possible "translation" of the hourglass model into molecular terminology would suggest that orthologs expressed in stages described by the tapered part of the hourglass should resemble one another more than orthologs expressed in the expansive parts that precede or succeed the phylotypic stage. We tested this hypothesis using 1,585 mouse genes expressed during 26 embryonic stages, and their human orthologs. Evolutionary divergence was estimated at different embryonic stages by calculating pairwise distances between corresponding orthologous proteins from mouse and human. Two independent datasets were used. One dataset contained genes that are expressed solely in a single developmental stage; the second was made of genes expressed at different developmental stages. In the second dataset the genes were classified according to their earliest stage of expression. We fitted second order polynomials to the two datasets. The two polynomials displayed minima as expected from the hourglass model. The molecular results suggest, albeit weakly, that a phylotypic stage (or period) indeed exists. Its temporal location, sometimes between the first-somites stage and the formation of the posterior neuropore, was in approximate agreement with the morphologically defined phylotypic stage. The molecular evidence for the later parts of the hourglass model, i.e., for von Baer's third law, was stronger than that for the earlier parts.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Embryos of taxonomically different vertebrates are thought to pass through a stage in which they resemble one another morphologically. This "vertebrate phylotypic stage" may represent the basic vertebrate body plan that was established in the common ancestor of vertebrates. However, much controversy remains about when the phylotypic stage appears, and whether it even exists. To overcome the limitations of studies based on morphological comparison, we explored a comprehensive quantitative method for defining the constrained stage using expressed sequence tag (EST) data, gene ontologies (GO), and available genomes of various animals. If strong developmental constraints occur during the phylotypic stage of vertebrate embryos, then genes conserved among vertebrates would be highly expressed at this stage.

RESULTS: We established a novel method for evaluating the ancestral nature of mouse embryonic stages that does not depend on comparative morphology. The numerical "ancestor index" revealed that the mouse indeed has a highly conserved embryonic period at embryonic day 8.0-8.5, the time of appearance of the pharyngeal arch and somites. During this period, the mouse prominently expresses GO-determined developmental genes shared among vertebrates. Similar analyses revealed the existence of a bilaterian-related period, during which GO-determined developmental genes shared among bilaterians are markedly expressed at the cleavage-to-gastrulation period. The genes associated with the phylotypic stage identified by our method are essential in embryogenesis.

CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that the mid-embryonic stage of the mouse is indeed highly constrained, supporting the existence of the phylotypic stage. Furthermore, this candidate stage is preceded by a putative bilaterian ancestor-related period. These results not only support the developmental hourglass model, but also highlight the hierarchical aspect of embryogenesis proposed by von Baer. Identification of conserved stages and tissues by this method in various animals would be a powerful tool to examine the phylotypic stage hypothesis, and to understand which kinds of developmental events and gene sets are evolutionarily constrained and how they limit the possible variations of animal basic body plans.},

abstract = {There has been a resurgence of interest in comparative embryology. It is now important to be able to compare gene expression in different species at similar developmental stages. One phenomenon which may make it difficult to compare embryos in this way is heterochrony--a change in developmental timing during evolution. It is not clear whether heterochrony can affect the intermediate stages of embryonic development, when many important genes involved in pattern formation are expressed. A prevalent view is that these so-called phylotypic stages are resistant to evolutionary change because they are when the body plan is laid down. Haeckel's famous drawings, which show different vertebrates developing from virtually identical somite-stage embryos, are still used to support this idea. I have reexamined the morphological data relating to developmental timing in somite-stage embryos. The data reveal striking patterns of heterochrony during vertebrate evolution. These shifts in developmental timing have strongly affected the phylotypic stage, which is therefore poorly conserved and is more appropriately described as the phylotypic period. This is contrary to the impression created by Haeckel's drawings, which I show to be inaccurate and misleading. The study of gene expression in embryos which show heterochrony could give important insights into evolutionary and developmental mechanisms.},

abstract = {The hourglass model of embryonic evolution predicts an hourglass-like divergence during animal embryogenesis - with embryos being more divergent at the earliest and latest stages but conserved during a mid-embryonic (phylotypic) period that serves as a source of the basic body plan for animals within a phylum. Morphological observations have suggested hourglass-like divergence in various vertebrate and invertebrate groups, and recent molecular data support this model. However, further investigation is required to determine whether the phylotypic period represents a basic body plan for each animal phylum, and whether this principle might apply at higher taxonomic levels. Here, we discuss the relationship between the basic body plan and the phylotypic stage, and address the possible mechanisms that underlie hourglass-like divergence.},
annote = {Review of the developmental hourglass model.

It starts saying that even when the morphological hourglass model has been supported by molecular data, there is no consensus on the mechanisms that drive the conservation of mid-embryogenesis.
It then suggests that, after determining the most conserved stages at the genetic level by transcriptome analysis, morphological data of these stages can be searched to determine the "basic body plan". 
It is interesting how the question have been turned upside down, what has been first notice as the conservation (less divergence) of some stages at the morphological level between aminals of the same phylum (and called as the phylotypic stage) and then kind of confirmed by the molecular data, now is suggested that we can search the phylotypic stage just by taking note of the traits present at the more genetically conserved (or less divergent) stages.

It goes through the couple of morphological (Bininda emonds, Richardson, wake, etc..) and different molecular approaches (single species gene expression data, multispecies transcriptomes, phylostratrografic by Domazet) to test this model. Specially notable is the Binida emonds on morphology, that is not consistent with the HG.

they also mentioned repeatedly that these conserved stages are still present after interphylum comparisons (Levin 2012), giving the example of the ventral closure of C elegans and pharyngula of X tropicalis.

As the causal mechanisms of this pattern, they mention the Duboule hox colinearity hypothesis and the Raff interdependency and complex signaling between organ primordia during the phylotypic stage. Kalinka and Tomancak suggest that early and late development (after finding that the elongated germ band stage is the most conserved in Drosophila) have diverged by the adaptation to specific ecological niches. Slack suggest the same but for reproductive strategies.
-- this both hypotheses would imply that these stages have a relaxed selection pressures and there has been more adaptation (measurable by adaptive fixations) at the early and late stages, which is contrary to our findings in drosophila--

the authors explicitly mentioned the importance of analyzing variation among inbred lines, natural populations, etc.. to see if the variation is the smallest at mid-embryogenesis (OUR STUDY)

abstract = {The concept of germ layers has been one of the foremost organizing principles in developmental biology, classification, systematics and evolution for 150 years (refs 1, 2, 3). Of the three germ layers, the mesoderm is found in bilaterian animals but is absent in species in the phyla Cnidaria and Ctenophora, which has been taken as evidence that the mesoderm was the final germ layer to evolve. The origin of the ectoderm and endoderm germ layers, however, remains unclear, with models supporting the antecedence of each as well as a simultaneous origin. Here we determine the temporal and spatial components of gene expression spanning embryonic development for all Caenorhabditis elegans genes and use it to determine the evolutionary ages of the germ layers. The gene expression program of the mesoderm is induced after those of the ectoderm and endoderm, thus making it the last germ layer both to evolve and to develop. Strikingly, the C. elegans endoderm and ectoderm expression programs do not co-induce; rather the endoderm activates earlier, and this is also observed in the expression of endoderm orthologues during the embryology of the frog Xenopus tropicalis, the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis and the sponge Amphimedon queenslandica. Querying the phylogenetic ages of specifically expressed genes reveals that the endoderm comprises older genes. Taken together, we propose that the endoderm program dates back to the origin of multicellularity, whereas the ectoderm originated as a secondary germ layer freed from ancestral feeding functions.},

As expected the correlation between the sum of the transcriptomes and the full embryo transcriptome decreased with time, because the lose of the signaling between cells.
Then they clustered genes by their spatiotemporally specificity and analyzed the ones that showed germlayer specific expression. They found that the endoderm genes are expressed before the others and that, using the phylostratographic method, they are older.
These genes are also enriched with metabolic and feeding related functions.
They then propose the hypothesis that the first multicellular metazoans (choanoflagelated-like) were in colonies where each mantained feeding and metabolism capabilities. Then the external cells of this agreggates could evolve other functions (epithelial endoderm to ectoderm) and finally that the last germ layer to evolve was the mesoderm..
thay say that their results agree with the gastrea hypothesis.

Apparently, 2 hypothesis existed, that genitalia forms with the limb bud mesenchyme (lateral plate mesoderm) or from the tail bud mesoderm.
For testing this hypothesis they first checked in different amniotes (lizard, snake, chicken and mouse) the relative position of the genitalia primordia in respect to the limb bud with microCT scanning). They show that in mouse the genitalia primordia is located in a more caudal position than in the squamates where the limb bud and the genitalia primordia are in the same AP position.
Then they marked with GFP the different subpopulations of mesenchyme (tail bud vs limb bud) showing that in mouse the genitalia come from a the ventral and tail-bud mesenchyme, in anolis the limb bud and genitalia is formed from the same mesenchyme and the chicken forms the genitalia from both mesenchyme populations.

Finally they make transcriptome analysis, using early and late tailbud and genitalia in anolis and mouse. Using hierarchiechal clustering (as I have!) they see that in anolis the early genitalia falls into the limb cluster, and then it separates in the late genitalia, while in the mouse both limb and genitalia are separated from early on.
They make a PCA analysis of this and determine the genes (THIS PART I SHOULD READ MORE CAREFULLY) that contribute to the separation of the PC2. they make a GOterm analysis of the 500 genes that contribute more and find an enrichment on signaling and TF genes. from these they select a subset as markers to make grafting analysis. they hypothesize that the cloaca is the signalling center that, depending on its AP position, recruits the different subpopulations of mesenchyme. They grafted cloaca tissue into the limbbud of the chicken and see that the mesenchyme tissue that surrounds it, show the expression of the markers and also an outgrowth is formed.
as a summary they hypothesize that the ancestral condition of the external genitalia in amniotes should have been derived from a limb-derived state, still evident in anolis development, but this changed in mammals as the two organs separated due to a shift in the cloaca position.},

Developmentally regulated gene networks, where timing and dynamic patterns of expression are critical, may be particularly sensitive to intron delays. We revisit and comment on a perspective last presented by Thummel 16 years ago: transcriptional delays may contribute to timing mechanisms during development. We discuss the presence of intron delays in genetic networks. We consider how delays can impact particular moments during development, which mechanistic attributes of transcription can influence them, how they can be modeled, and how they can be studied using recent technological advances as well as classical genetics.},
annote = {review of the Intron delay hypothesis, that states that the length of the introns of a gene might play an important role in stablishing a precise timing for gene expression, as the processing of the intronic sequences can be costly in time.

some nice examples of this: knirps has an homologue(krnl) in d. melanogaster, which is much longer in intronic sequence. knrl seems to be not necessary for segmentation, and the gene cannot rescue the knirps mutation, however, the mRNA can rescue the knirps mutant, highlighting the importance for the early genes in drosophila to have short introns or even any introns at all.

They say that has been proven that the maternal-zygotic transitions genes have very low intron length and have significantly more genes without introns.

Another example is the segmentation clock in somitogenesis. an intron delay can serve as the clock in an autoinhibitory loop by a TF. the time that the machinery spends in removing the introns of a gene sequence would be the time that this gene can be active before it autoinhibits itself.

they say that the difference between intron lenght of two orthologues, can be indicative of the time since the last common ancestor for these (time of gene duplication)

introns have other functions associated as they have regulatory sequences and alternative splicing sites.},

Subsequently, each neuroblast goes through an invariant cell lineage to generate neurons and/or glia. Using molecular lineage markers, I show that (1) each neuroblast forms at a stereotyped time and position; (2) the neuroblast pattern is indistinguishable between thoracic and abdominal segments; (3) the development of individual neuroblasts can be followed throughout early neurogenesis; (4) gene expression in a neuroblast can be reproducibly modulated during its cell lineage; (5) identified ganglion mother cells form at stereotyped times and positions; and (6) the cell lineage of four well-characterized neurons can be traced back to two identified neuroblasts. These results set the stage for investigating neuroblast specification and the mechanisms controlling neuroblast cell lineages.},

abstract = {Developmental conservation among related species is a common generalization known as von Baer's third law and implies that early stages of development are the most refractory to change. The "hourglass model" is an alternative view that proposes that middle stages are the most constrained during development. To investigate this issue, we undertook a genomic approach and provide insights into how natural selection operates on genes expressed during the first 24 h of Drosophila ontogeny in the six species of the melanogaster group for which whole genome sequences are available. Having studied the rate of evolution of more than 2,000 developmental genes, our results showed differential selective pressures at different moments of embryogenesis. In many Drosophila species, early zygotic genes evolved slower than maternal genes indicating that mid-embryogenesis is the stage most refractory to evolutionary change. Interestingly, positively selected genes were found in all embryonic stages even during the period with the highest developmental constraint, emphasizing that positive selection and negative selection are not mutually exclusive as it is often mistakenly considered. Among the fastest evolving genes, we identified a network of nucleoporins (Nups) as part of the maternal transcriptome. Specifically, the acceleration of Nups was driven by positive selection only in the more recently diverged species. Because many Nups are involved in hybrid incompatibilities between species of the Drosophila melanogaster subgroup, our results link rapid evolution of early developmental genes with reproductive isolation. In summary, our study revealed that even within functional groups of genes evolving under strong negative selection many positively selected genes could be recognized. Understanding these exceptions to the broad evolutionary conservation of early expressed developmental genes can shed light into relevant processes driving the evolution of species divergence.},

abstract = {The role of adaptation is a fundamental question in molecular evolution. Theory predicts that species with large effective population sizes should undergo a higher rate of adaptive evolution than species with low effective population sizes if adaptation is limited by the supply of mutations. Previous analyses have appeared to support this conjecture because estimates of the proportion of nonsynonymous substitutions fixed by adaptive evolution, $\alpha$, tend to be higher in species with large N(e). However, $\alpha$ is a function of both the number of advantageous and effectively neutral substitutions, either of which might depend on N(e). Here, we investigate the relationship between N(e) and $\omega$(a), the rate of adaptive evolution relative to the rate of neutral evolution, using nucleotide polymorphism and divergence data from 13 independent pairs of eukaryotic species. We find a highly significant positive correlation between $\omega$(a) and N(e). We also find some evidence that the rate of adaptive evolution varies between groups of organisms for a given N(e). The correlation between $\omega$(a) and N(e) does not appear to be an artifact of demographic change or selection on synonymous codon use. Our results suggest that adaptation is to some extent limited by the supply of mutations and that at least some adaptation depends on newly occurring mutations rather than on standing genetic variation. Finally, we show that the proportion of nearly neutral nonadaptive substitutions declines with increasing N(e). The low rate of adaptive evolution and the high proportion of effectively neutral substitution in species with small N(e) are expected to combine to make it difficult to detect adaptive molecular evolution in species with small N(e).},

abstract = {What proportion of the traits of individuals has been optimally shaped by natural selection and what has not? Here, we estimate the maximal number of those traits using a mathematical model for natural selection in multitrait organisms. The model represents the most ideal conditions for natural selection: a simple genotype-phenotype map and independent variation between traits. The model is also used to disentangle the influence of fitness functions and the number of traits, n, per se on the efficiency of natural selection. We also allow n to evolve. Our simulations show that, for all fitness functions and even in the best conditions optimal phenotypes are rarely encountered, only for n = 1, and that a large proportion of traits are always far from their optimum, specially for large n. This happens to different degrees depending on the fitness functions (additive linear, additive nonlinear, Gaussian and multiplicative). The traits that arise earlier in evolution account for a larger proportion of the absolute fitness of individuals. Thus, complex phenotypes have, in proportion, more traits that are far from optimal and the closeness to the optimum correlates with the age of the trait. Based on estimated population sizes, mutation rates and selection coefficients, we provide an upper estimation of the number of traits that can become and remain adapted by direct natural selection.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Multicellular organisms consist of cells of many different types that are established during development. Each type of cell is characterized by the unique combination of expressed gene products as a result of spatiotemporal gene regulation. Currently, a fundamental challenge in regulatory biology is to elucidate the gene expression controls that generate the complex body plans during development. Recent advances in high-throughput biotechnologies have generated spatiotemporal expression patterns for thousands of genes in the model organism fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Existing qualitative methods enhanced by a quantitative analysis based on computational tools we present in this paper would provide promising ways for addressing key scientific questions.

RESULTS: We develop a set of computational methods and open source tools for identifying co-expressed embryonic domains and the associated genes simultaneously. To map the expression patterns of many genes into the same coordinate space and account for the embryonic shape variations, we develop a mesh generation method to deform a meshed generic ellipse to each individual embryo. We then develop a co-clustering formulation to cluster the genes and the mesh elements, thereby identifying co-expressed embryonic domains and the associated genes simultaneously. Experimental results indicate that the gene and mesh co-clusters can be correlated to key developmental events during the stages of embryogenesis we study. The open source software tool has been made available at http://compbio.cs.odu.edu/fly/.

CONCLUSIONS: Our mesh generation and machine learning methods and tools improve upon the flexibility, ease-of-use and accuracy of existing methods.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Drosophila melanogaster is a major model organism for investigating the function and interconnection of animal genes in the earliest stages of embryogenesis. Today, images capturing Drosophila gene expression patterns are being produced at a higher throughput than ever before. The analysis of spatial patterns of gene expression is most biologically meaningful when images from a similar time point during development are compared. Thus, the critical first step is to determine the developmental stage of an embryo. This information is also needed to observe and analyze expression changes over developmental time. Currently, developmental stages (time) of embryos in images capturing spatial expression pattern are annotated manually, which is time- and labor-intensive. Embryos are often designated into stage ranges, making the information on developmental time course. This makes downstream analyses inefficient and biological interpretations of similarities and differences in spatial expression patterns challenging, particularly when using automated tools for analyzing expression patterns of large number of images.

RESULTS: Here, we present a new computational approach to annotate developmental stage for Drosophila embryos in the gene expression images. In an analysis of 3724 images, the new approach shows high accuracy in predicting the developmental stage correctly (79{\%}). In addition, it provides a stage score that enables one to more finely annotate each embryo so that they are divided into early and late periods of development within standard stage demarcations. Stage scores for all images containing expression patterns of the same gene enable a direct way to view expression changes over developmental time for any gene. We show that the genomewide-expression-maps generated using images from embryos in refined stages illuminate global gene activities and changes much better, and more refined stage annotations improve our ability to better interpret results when expression pattern matches are discovered between genes.

abstract = {The separation of neural from epidermal progenitor cells in the ventral neuroectoderm of Drosophila is thought to be mediated by cellular interactions. In order to verify the occurrence of regulatory signals and to test the neurogenic capabilities of cells from various regions of the ectoderm, we have carried out homotopic and heterotopic transplantations of single ectodermal cells. We found that cells from any of the tested regions, with the exception of the proctodeal anlage, are capable of developing as neuroblasts following their transplantation into the ventral neuroectoderm. These neurogenic capabilities are gradually distributed. Cells from the procephalic and ventral neurogenic regions exhibit maximal capabilities, as shown by their behavior in heterotopic transplantations. However, the two neurogenic regions differ from each other in that no epidermalising signals can be demonstrated to occur within the procephalic neuroectoderm, whereas such signals are strong within the ventral neuroectoderm; in addition, neuralising signals from neighbouring cells seem to be necessary for neuroectodermal cells to develop as neuroblasts. Other ectodermal regions whose cells exhibit weaker neurogenic capabilities are, in decreasing order of capability, the dorsal epidermal anlage, the anterolateral region of the procephalic lobe, comprising the anlage of the pharynx, and the anterior pole of the embryo, corresponding to the anlagen of the stomodeum and ectodermal anterior midgut. We assume that, during development in situ, the neurogenic capabilities of all these cells are suppressed by inhibitory signals, which are released upon heterotopic transplantation into the neuroectoderm. A community effect which prevents groups of dorsal epidermal cells from taking on a neural fate upon their transplantation into the ventral neuroectoderm, is shown. Finally, we hypothesize that the lack of neurogenic capability in the cells from the proctodeal anlage is due to the absence of products of the proneural genes.},

abstract = {The Drosophila CNS midline cells constitute a specialized set of interneurons, motorneurons, and glia. The utility of the CNS midline cells as a neurogenomic system to study CNS development derives from the ability to easily identify CNS midline-expressed genes. For this study, we used a variety of sources to identify 281 putative midline-expressed genes, including enhancer trap lines, microarray data, published accounts, and the Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project (BDGP) gene expression data. For each gene, we analyzed expression at all stages of embryonic CNS development and categorized expression patterns with regard to specific midline cell types. Of the 281 candidates, we identified 224 midline-expressed genes, which include transcription factors, signaling proteins, and transposable elements. We find that 58 genes are expressed in mesectodermal precursor cells, 138 in midline primordium cells, and 143 in mature midline cells--50 in midline glia, 106 in midline neurons. Additionally, we identified 27 genes expressed in glial and mesodermal cells associated with the midline cells. This work provides the basis for future research that will generate a complete cellular and molecular map of CNS midline development, thus allowing for detailed genetic and molecular studies of neuronal and glial development and function.},

abstract = {During limb development, digits emerge from the undifferentiated mesenchymal tissue that constitutes the limb bud. It has been proposed that this process is controlled by a self-organizing Turing mechanism, whereby diffusible molecules interact to produce a periodic pattern of digital and interdigital fates. However, the identities of the molecules remain unknown. By combining experiments and modeling, we reveal evidence that a Turing network implemented by Bmp, Sox9, and Wnt drives digit specification. We develop a realistic two-dimensional simulation of digit patterning and show that this network, when modulated by morphogen gradients, recapitulates the expression patterns of Sox9 in the wild type and in perturbation experiments. Our systems biology approach reveals how a combination of growth, morphogen gradients, and a self-organizing Turing network can achieve robust and reproducible pattern formation.},

they found that Bmp and Wnt are out of phase. Then, knowing that BMP insuce Sox9 and Sox9 is inhibited by WNT, they fixed these interactions and search for all different interactions that could produce the alternating pattern and in or out of phase of the molecules. 

        
They get the simpler network that produce a robust pattern and first reproduce the patterns that are produced with culterd cells of the buds and then in the limb bud.

        
The three-node model produces some random pattern in the limb bud (with growth) and in order to get the real pattern they introduce FGF and Hoxd13. With these molecules affecting some parameters of the three node model they can reproduce the digit patterning.

        
They finally test the model by doing some bead experiments, and inhibitions.
They suggest that as FGF affects both PD digit lenght and digit width permiting scale invariance.},

abstract = {In embryos of Drosophila melanogaster all the nuclei in the syncytial egg divide with global synchrony during the first 13 mitotic cycles. But with cellularization in the 14th cycle, global mitotic synchrony ceases. Starting about one hour into the 14th interphase, at least 25 'mitotic domains', which are clusters of cells united by locally synchronous mitosis, partition the embryo blastoderm surface into a complex fine-scale pattern. These mitotic domains, which are constant from one embryo to the next, fire in the same temporal sequence in every embryo. Some domains consist of a single cell cluster straddling the ventral or dorsal midline. Most consist of two separate cell clusters that occupy mirror-image positions on the bilaterally symmetric embryo. Others comprise a series of members present not only as bilateral pairs but also as metameric repeats. Thus a domain can consist of either one, two, or many (if metamerically reiterated) clusters of contiguous cells. Within each cluster, mitosis starts in a single cell or in a small number of interior cells then spreads wave-like, in all directions, until it stops at the domain boundary. Each domain occupies a specific position along the anteroposterior axis--as determined by the expression pattern of the engrailed protein, and along the dorsoventral axis--as determined by cell count from the ventral midline. The primordia of certain larval structures appear to consist solely of the cells of one specific mitotic domain. Moreover, cells in at least some mitotic domains share specific morphogenetic traits, distinct from those of cells in adjacent domains. These traits include cell shape, spindle orientation, and participation by all the cells of a domain in an invagination. The specialized behaviors of the various mitotic domains transform the monolayer cell sheet of the blastoderm into the multilayered gastrula. I conclude that the fine-scale partitioning of the newly cellularized embryo into mitotic domains is an early manifestation of the commitment of cells to specific developmental fates.},

Such scaling involves adjusting the intrinsic scale of spatial patterns of gene expression that are set up during development to the size of the system. Identifying the mechanisms that regulate scaling of patterns at the tissue, organ and organism level during development is a longstanding challenge in biology, but recent molecular-level data and mathematical modeling have shed light on scaling mechanisms in several systems, including Drosophila and Xenopus. Here, we investigate the underlying principles needed for understanding the mechanisms that can produce scale invariance in spatial pattern formation and discuss examples of systems that scale during development.},

However, the biological function of these unannotated transcribed regions is largely unknown. Approximately 7{\%} and 23{\%} of the detected transcribed nucleotides during D. melanogaster embryogenesis map to unannotated intergenic and intronic regions, respectively. Based on computational analysis of coordinated transcription, we conservatively estimate that 29{\%} of all unannotated transcribed sequences function as missed or alternative exons of well-characterized protein-coding genes. We estimate that 15.6{\%} of intergenic transcribed regions function as missed or alternative transcription start sites (TSS) used by 11.4{\%} of the expressed protein-coding genes. Identification of P element mutations within or near newly identified 5' exons provides a strategy for mapping previously uncharacterized mutations to their respective genes. Collectively, these data indicate that at least 85{\%} of the fly genome is transcribed and processed into mature transcripts representing at least 30{\%} of the fly genome.},

Here we have identified new genes, transcripts and proteins using poly(A)(+) RNA sequencing from Drosophila melanogaster in cultured cell lines, dissected organ systems and under environmental perturbations. We found that a small set of mostly neural-specific genes has the potential to encode thousands of transcripts each through extensive alternative promoter usage and RNA splicing. The magnitudes of splicing changes are larger between tissues than between developmental stages, and most sex-specific splicing is gonad-specific. Gonads express hundreds of previously unknown coding and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), some of which are antisense to protein-coding genes and produce short regulatory RNAs. Furthermore, previously identified pervasive intergenic transcription occurs primarily within newly identified introns. The fly transcriptome is substantially more complex than previously recognized, with this complexity arising from combinatorial usage of promoters, splice sites and polyadenylation sites.},

abstract = {The embryonic cuticle of Drosophila melanogaster is deposited by the epidermal epithelium during stage 16 of development. This tough, waterproof layer is essential for maintaining the structural integrity of the larval body. We have characterized mutations in a set of genes required for proper deposition and/or morphogenesis of the cuticle. Zygotic disruption of any one of these genes results in embryonic lethality. Mutant embryos are hyperactive within the eggshell, resulting in a high proportion reversed within the eggshell (the "retroactive" phenotype), and all show poor cuticle integrity when embryos are mechanically devitellinized. This last property results in embryonic cuticle preparations that appear grossly inflated compared to wild-type cuticles (the "blimp" phenotype). We find that one of these genes, krotzkopf verkehrt (kkv), encodes the Drosophila chitin synthase enzyme and that a closely linked gene, knickkopf (knk), encodes a novel protein that shows genetic interaction with the Drosophila E-cadherin, shotgun. We also demonstrate that two other known mutants, grainy head (grh) and retroactive (rtv), show the blimp phenotype when devitellinized, and we describe a new mutation, called zeppelin (zep), that shows the blimp phenotype but does not produce defects in the head cuticle as the other mutations do.

abstract = {Rapidly proliferating cells such as cancer cells and embryonic stem cells rely on a specialized metabolic program known as aerobic glycolysis, which supports biomass production from carbohydrates. The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster also utilizes aerobic glycolysis to support the rapid growth that occurs during larval development. Here we use singular value decomposition analysis of modENCODE RNA-seq data combined with GC-MS-based metabolomic analysis to analyze the changes in gene expression and metabolism that occur during Drosophila embryogenesis, spanning the onset of aerobic glycolysis. Unexpectedly, we find that the most common pattern of co-expressed genes in embryos includes the global switch to glycolytic gene expression that occurs midway through embryogenesis. In contrast to the canonical aerobic glycolytic pathway, however, which is accompanied by reduced mitochondrial oxidative metabolism, the expression of genes involved in the tricarboxylic cycle (TCA cycle) and the electron transport chain are also upregulated at this time. Mitochondrial activity, however, appears to be attenuated, as embryos exhibit a block in the TCA cycle that results in elevated levels of citrate, isocitrate, and $\alpha$-ketoglutarate. We also find that genes involved in lipid breakdown and $\beta$-oxidation are upregulated prior to the transcriptional initiation of glycolysis, but are downregulated before the onset of larval development, revealing coordinated use of lipids and carbohydrates during development. These observations demonstrate the efficient use of nutrient stores to support embryonic development, define sequential metabolic transitions during this stage, and demonstrate striking similarities between the metabolic state of late-stage fly embryos and tumor cells.},

Information on embryonic metabolism during developmental progression is important for further understanding the mechanisms of Drosophila embryogenesis. Therefore, the aim of this study is to assess the changes in embryos' metabolome that occur at different stages of the Drosophila embryonic development. Time course samples of Drosophila embryos were subjected to GC/MS-based metabolome analysis for profiling of low molecular weight hydrophilic metabolites, including sugars, amino acids, and organic acids. The results showed that the metabolic profiles of Drosophila embryo varied during the course of development and there was a strong correlation between the metabolome and different embryonic stages. Using the metabolome information, we were able to establish a prediction model for developmental stages of embryos starting from their high-resolution quantitative metabolite composition. Among the important metabolites revealed from our model, we suggest that different amino acids appear to play distinct roles in different developmental stages and an appropriate balance in trehalose-glucose ratio is crucial to supply the carbohydrate source for the development of Drosophila embryo.},

In sequentially segmenting animals, the rhythm of segmentation is reported to be controlled by the time scale of genetic oscillations that periodically trigger new segment formation. However, we present real-time measurements of genetic oscillations in zebrafish embryos showing that their time scale is not sufficient to explain the temporal period of segmentation. A second time scale, the rate of tissue shortening, contributes to the period of segmentation through a Doppler effect. This contribution is modulated by a gradual change in the oscillation profile across the tissue. We conclude that the rhythm of segmentation is an emergent property controlled by the time scale of genetic oscillations, the change of oscillation profile, and tissue shortening.},

They then compare the wave with the formation of the somites and realize that the wave of formation of somites dont coincide with the genetic wave (based on oscilatory gene networks). 

        
in the anterior part (the genetic wave goes from posterior to anterior) the presomitic mesoderm reduces its length as the somites are formed, so the anterior frontier moves to the posterior region.

        
This partly explains the mismatch in the waves, as in the anterior part the period is faster than the posterior part and 10 somites are formed during 9 posterior oscilations.

        
This can be thought as a doppler effect in which the anterioir part is moving towards a source of sound and perceives a shorter wavelength.

        
Then they finsd than in the posterior part the period becomes slower in time, oppsing partially the effect of the doppler effect.

        
They conclude that in somitogenesis, wavetravelling, doppler efect (as tissue contraction) and period variation of the oscilations have to be taken in to account and the model of static somitogenesis clock or the scaling wave are simplifications and dont match with in vivo observation.

Most clustering algorithms are unable to distinguish between real and random patterns.

RESULTS: We present an algorithm specifically designed for clustering short time series expression data. Our algorithm works by assigning genes to a predefined set of model profiles that capture the potential distinct patterns that can be expected from the experiment. We discuss how to obtain such a set of profiles and how to determine the significance of each of these profiles. Significant profiles are retained for further analysis and can be combined to form clusters. We tested our method on both simulated and real biological data. Using immune response data we show that our algorithm can correctly detect the temporal profile of relevant functional categories. Using Gene Ontology analysis we show that our algorithm outperforms both general clustering algorithms and algorithms designed specifically for clustering time series gene expression data.

abstract = {The origin of the turtle shell over 200 million years ago greatly modified the amniote body plan, and the morphological plasticity of the shell has promoted the adaptive radiation of turtles. The shell, comprising a dorsal carapace and a ventral plastron, is a layered structure formed by basal endochondral axial skeletal elements (ribs, vertebrae) and plates of bone, which are overlain by keratinous ectodermal scutes. Studies of turtle development have mostly focused on the bones of the shell; however, the genetic regulation of the epidermal scutes has not been investigated. Here, we show that scutes develop from an array of patterned placodes and that these placodes are absent from a soft-shelled turtle in which scutes were lost secondarily. Experimentally inhibiting Shh, Bmp or Fgf signaling results in the disruption of the placodal pattern. Finally, a computational model is used to show how two coupled reaction-diffusion systems reproduce both natural and abnormal variation in turtle scutes. Taken together, these placodal signaling centers are likely to represent developmental modules that are responsible for the evolution of scutes in turtles, and the regulation of these centers has allowed for the diversification of the turtle shell.},

abstract = {Early cell lineages and arrangement of blastomeres in C. elegans are similar to the pattern found in Ascaris and other studied nematodes leading to the assumption that embryonic development shows little variation within the phylum Nematoda. However, analysis of a larger variety of species from various branches of the phylogenetic tree demonstrate that prominent variations in crucial steps of early embryogenesis exist among representatives of this taxon. So far, most of these variations have only been studied on a descriptive level and thus essentially nothing is known about their molecular or genetic basis. Nevertheless, it is obvious that the limited morphological diversity of the freshly hatched juvenile and the uniformity of the basic body plan contrast with the many modifications in the way a worm is generated from the egg cell. This chapter focuses on the initial phase between egg activation and gastrulation and deals with the following aspects: reproduction and diploidy, polarity, cleavage and germ line, cell lineages; cell cycles and maternal contribution, cell-cell communication and cell specification, gastrulation.},
annote = {It makes a review of the embryological variation in nematodes. The main point is that the variation in nematodes have been underestimated as other nematodes have simmilar development as C. elegans.
He notes however that the variation on the early development doesnt reflect the variation at the hatching, as the worms have the same morphology.


he separates the variation in different categories:


-Polar bodies formation: there are different strategies for establishment of diploidy. Variation in the first meiotic and mitotic divisions.


-Polarity. In C. elegans almost all the polarity is evident at the first division with the AB cells (somatic) separating from the germ cell progenitos. Also the animal (posterior) pole is towards the vulva. In other species the asymmetric cell divisions is not evident and the anterior pole goes toward the vulva or even with no preference towards it.


-Cleavage. Asymetric cleavage in the first divisions is not always observed. The granules that seems to play a role on conservation of germ cells might not have the same function in other nematodes. 


-Cell lineage. "lineage homology between the two species (Pellioditis marina and C elegans) is very high (about 95{\%}) but fate homology considerably lower (about 75{\%}). The authors suggested that the differences in the fate distribution pattern are due to different compromises between minimizing the number of specification events and minimizing the need for time-consuming cell migrations"


-Cell cycles and maternal distribution
High variance in time (10min- 7 hrs). Compares until which cell number stage the embryogenesis goes apparently normal when blocking transcription in early embryos. This determines how many cell-number stages are only maternally driven.In addition, cell cycle durations change over time. They explain these variations with different availability of maternal and zygotic gene products.


-Cell communication and specification
The early cell fate specification in C elegans is not observed in other ("more plastic") species.


-Gastrulation. C elegans gastrulation consist in 2 cells ingressing and after more cells immigrating with only a rudimentary blastocoel. One other species have a large blastocoel in the 64-cell, and then gastrulate. this seems to be the ancestral character.


CONCLUSSIONS.
He suggests that the ealy embryogenesis is more variable could be because of the higher integration of developmental modules in later embryogenesis.


Asks at what extent the developmental processes floolow darwinian rules of variation-selection and how the interplay of genetic change and environment determines the chance of an adaptive change.},

They used text based anotations.


They reconstructed the embryo clustering domains of co-regulated enhancers, simmilar to frise and fatemap. (compare to ours!)




most of the enhancers acted in cis (82{\%})


They matched the expression of their most strongly expressed enhancers with mRNA of BDGP, comparing with 5 upstream and 5 downstream genes. With that they found that most of the enhancers reproduce the expression of the neighbouring genes (THE MAJORITY ARE INTRAGENIC) but some of them skipped 1 or more genes.


Median distance from enhancer to their target genes is 10kb.


They then take all the enhancers that drive expression in specific tissues to look if there is enrochment of some binding domain (GATA, GAGA, or gene specific..) 
They found several good matches: for example that early mesoderm enhancers were enriched with Twist like domain, consistent with its know function.


They asses the importance of these motif (necessity) by point mutations in similar constructs. The assay validated the requirement of most of them.

It first analyze what kind of life cycle Billaterian show. It says that the simple larva kind is the most widespread and probably the ancestral type of life cycle. It also says that the type I is the most widespread, the type 2 and 3 correspond to exceptions in vertebrates and insects.


It makes a hint on the variation expected on early embryos of type 1 and 2 but doesnt go further away. (isaac does it) but then tals about the great variation of both types of patternings so is not clear..


He concludes that type 1 i capable to achieve "all extant body plans" it is at the phylum level (chordata), but doesnt mention that within some phylae the more complex animals dont have type 1 so type 1 is not capable to produce complex animals.


He does say that large eggs animals dont show type 1, for mechanistic reasons. He links the egg size change with ecological factors (predation, maternal investment)


He then points out that the animals that have a secondary shift towards small eggs dont regain type 1 (mammals). He wonders if it is possible mechanistically, but i think that is in maybe not possible because to achieve the final morphology changing from 2 to 1 is maybe not possible as type2 and 3 are usually more complex animals.

abstract = {Animal and plant development starts with a constituting phase called embryogenesis, which evolved independently in both lineages. Comparative anatomy of vertebrate development--based on the Meckel-Serr{\`{e}}s law and von Baer's laws of embryology from the early nineteenth century--shows that embryos from various taxa appear different in early stages, converge to a similar form during mid-embryogenesis, and again diverge in later stages. This morphogenetic series is known as the embryonic 'hourglass', and its bottleneck of high conservation in mid-embryogenesis is referred to as the phylotypic stage. Recent analyses in zebrafish and Drosophila embryos provided convincing molecular support for the hourglass model, because during the phylotypic stage the transcriptome was dominated by ancient genes and global gene expression profiles were reported to be most conserved. Although extensively explored in animals, an embryonic hourglass has not been reported in plants, which represent the second major kingdom in the tree of life that evolved embryogenesis. Here we provide phylotranscriptomic evidence for a molecular embryonic hourglass in Arabidopsis thaliana, using two complementary approaches. This is particularly significant because the possible absence of an hourglass based on morphological features in plants suggests that morphological and molecular patterns might be uncoupled. Together with the reported developmental hourglass patterns in animals, these findings indicate convergent evolution of the molecular hourglass and a conserved logic of embryogenesis across kingdoms.},

abstract = {Vertebrate Hox genes are essential for the proper organization of the body plan during development. Inactivation of these genes usually leads to important alterations, or transformations, in the identities of the affected developing structures. Hox genes are activated in a progressive temporal sequence which is colinear with the position of these genes on their respective complexes, so that `anterior' genes are activated earlier than `posterior' ones (temporal colinearity). Here, an hypothesis is considered in which the correct timing of activation of this gene family is necessary in order to properly establish the various expression domains. Slight modifications in the respective times of gene activation (heterochronies) may shift expression domains along the rostrocaudal axis and thus induce concurrent changes in morphologies. It is further argued that temporal colinearity only occurs in cells with high mitotic rates, which results in a strong linkage between patterning and growth control and makes the patterning process unidirectional, from anterior, proximal and early, to posterior, distal and late, a model referred to as the `Einbahnstrasse'. While the nature of the mechanism(s) behind temporal and spatial colinearities is unknown, it is proposed that such a mechanism relies on meta-cis interactions, that is it may necessitate gene contiguity. Such a mechanism would be based on DNA-specific, rather than gene-specific, features such as chromatin configurations or DNA replication. The existence of such a meta-cis mechanism would explain the extraordinary conservation of this genetic system during evolution as its basic properties would be linked to that of the genetic material itself. Consequently, it is hypothesized that, in vertebrates, the resistance of this mechanism to evolutionary variations may be the reason for the existence of a short developmental window of morphological invariance (the phylotypic progression).},

abstract = {The concept of a phylotypic stage, when all vertebrate embryos show low phenotypic diversity, is an important cornerstone underlying modern developmental biology. Many theories involving patterns of development, developmental modules, mechanisms of development including developmental integration, and the action of natural selection on embryological stages have been proposed with reference to the phylotypic stage. However, the phylotypic stage has never been precisely defined, or conclusively supported or disproved by comparative quantitative data. We tested the predictions of the 'developmental hourglass' definition of the phylotypic stage quantitatively by looking at the pattern of developmental-timing variation across vertebrates as a whole and within mammals. For both datasets, the results using two different metrics were counter to the predictions of the definition: phenotypic variation between species was highest in the middle of the developmental sequence. This surprising degree of developmental character independence argues against the existence of a phylotypic stage in vertebrates. Instead, we hypothesize that numerous tightly delimited developmental modules exist during the mid-embryonic period. Further, the high level of timing changes (heterochrony) between these modules may be an important evolutionary mechanism giving rise to the diversity of vertebrates. The onus is now clearly on proponents of the phylotypic stage to present both a clear definition of it and quantitative data supporting its existence.},

abstract = {Epithelial folding mediated by apical constriction converts flat epithelial sheets into multilayered, complex tissue structures and is used throughout development in most animals. Little is known, however, about how forces produced near the apical surface of the tissue are transmitted within individual cells to generate the global changes in cell shape that characterize tissue deformation. Here we apply particle tracking velocimetry in gastrulating Drosophila embryos to measure the movement of cytoplasm and plasma membrane during ventral furrow formation. We find that cytoplasmic redistribution during the lengthening phase of ventral furrow formation can be precisely described by viscous flows that quantitatively match the predictions of hydrodynamics. Cell membranes move with the ambient cytoplasm, with little resistance to, or driving force on, the flow. Strikingly, apical constriction produces similar flow patterns in mutant embryos that fail to form cells before gastrulation ('acellular' embryos), such that the global redistribution of cytoplasm mirrors the summed redistribution occurring in individual cells of wild-type embryos. Our results indicate that during the lengthening phase of ventral furrow formation, hydrodynamic behaviour of the cytoplasm provides the predominant mechanism transmitting apically generated forces deep into the tissue and that cell individualization is dispensable.},

We develop the control profile, a statistic that quantifies the different proportions of control-inducing structures present in a network.

The profiles of real networks form three well-defined clusters that provide insight into the high-level organization and function of complex systems.},

-Internal dilation: when a branch is divided and then rejoined.

        
To have total control of the network, one has to control all the sources, and have a control of each dilation.

        
The networks can then be classified depending on the proportions of this 3 types of nodes. They then analyze different real complex networks and argue that:
source-dominated networks, such as neural and social networks, allow relatively uncorrelated behavior across their agents and are thus suitable to distributed processing.
Internal-dilation–dominated networks, such as food networks are mostly closed systems and obey some type of conservation laws. 
Finally, external-dilation–dominated networks with their surplus sink nodes yield correlated behaviors across their agents that are downstream from a common source, as transcriptional systems.

abstract = {Biological oscillations are observed at many levels of cellular organization. In the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum, starvation-triggered multicellular development is organized by periodic cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP) waves, which provide both chemoattractant gradients and developmental signals. We report that GtaC, a GATA transcription factor, exhibits rapid nucleocytoplasmic shuttling in response to cAMP waves. This behavior requires coordinated action of a nuclear localization signal and reversible G protein (heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding protein)-coupled receptor-mediated phosphorylation. Although both are required for developmental gene expression, receptor occupancy promotes nuclear exit of GtaC, which leads to a transient burst of transcription at each cAMP cycle. We demonstrate that this biological circuit filters out high-frequency signals and counts those admitted, thereby enabling cells to modulate gene expression according to the dynamic pattern of the external stimuli.},
annote = {they find a mechanism in Dictyostelium discoideum that translateor decode the cAMP waves into gene expression as a timer.

        
The mechanism depends on the repression (by moving out of the nucleus) of a GATA TF after the cAMP is bound to the receptor. If the cAMP is countinously bounded there is no activation, so when the cycle is at low frequency the TF is activated transiently and in a cummulative way (the concentration of genes that are activated downstream of the TF increase linearly with the pulses).

        
The circuit "filters out high-frequency signals and counts those admitted" allowing a population level synchronization.

        
The global level of cAMP is not important, the important is the frquency of the waves.

        
the frequency of cAMP oscillations progressively increases as development enters the mound stage. Thus, thelow frequency filter may allowthe transition into the next developmental stage.

We devised a method called "affinity propagation," which takes as input measures of similarity between pairs of data points. Real-valued messages are exchanged between data points until a high-quality set of exemplars and corresponding clusters gradually emerges. We used affinity propagation to cluster images of faces, detect genes in microarray data, identify representative sentences in this manuscript, and identify cities that are efficiently accessed by airline travel.

abstract = {We present a mathematical model for the morphogenesis and patterning of the mesenchymal condensations that serve as primordia of the avian limb skeleton. The model is based on the experimentally established dynamics of a multiscale regulatory network consisting of two glycan-binding proteins expressed early in limb development: CG (chicken galectin)-1A, CG-8 and their counterreceptors that determine the formation, size, number and spacing of the "protocondensations" that give rise to the condensations and subsequently the cartilaginous elements that serve as the templates of the bones. The model, a system of partial differential and integro-differential equations containing a flux term to represent local adhesion gradients, is simulated in a "full" and a "reduced" form to confirm that the system has pattern-forming capabilities and to explore the nature of the patterning instability. The full model recapitulates qualitatively and quantitatively the experimental results of network perturbation and leads to new predictions, which are verified by further experimentation. The reduced model is used to demonstrate that the patterning process is inherently morphodynamic, with cell motility being intrinsic to it. Furthermore, subtle relationships between cell movement and the positive and negative interactions between the morphogens produce regular patterns without the requirement for activators and inhibitors with widely separated diffusion coefficients. The described mechanism thus represents an extension of the category of activator-inhibitor processes capable of generating biological patterns with repetitive elements beyond the morphostatic mechanisms of the Turing/Gierer-Meinhardt type.},
annote = {they make a mathematical model for the condensation of the precartilaginous mesenchyme in the chick limb, in which cell adhesion and cell migration is neccesary for the pattern formation.


The model is based in evidence that the galectins 1 and 8 are important to make the condensations. cg1 induce condensations and cg8 inhibits condensations.


They propose a network with these two galectins inducing the expression of the other, by binding to a receptor. there are two receptors, one is shared by cg1 and 8, and the other is exclusive for 8.
When cg1 is bound to the shared receptor, the expression of cg8 and the shared receptor is induced. The bound cg8 to the exclusive receptor induce the cg1. the bound of cg8 to the shared receptor doesnt have any effect but to block the bibding of cg1.


the mathematical model calculates the density of the cells (in 1D) integrating over various concentrations in space and time. the relevant variables are cell migration (browninan motion) cell-cell adhesion (bound cg1 + all bound cg1 in a sensing radio) binding of galectins to receptors and the not bound receptors.


They show that the model (and also a reduced version of it) is capable of pattern formation as a periodic pattern of waves (from space 0 to 1). The model reproduces the empirical evidence of increased number of condensations after adding cg1, and decreased number after adding cg8 (less clearly).


Then they demonstrate that for this mechanism of pattern formation the cell motility is necessary, so the mechanism is inherently "morphodynamic"(sensu isaac).


However, it seems to me that they dont explore the possibility of pattern formation in a morphostatic way exhaustively, and one assumption in the morphostatic model is that the diffusion for both galectins is the same. I wonder if having different diffusion the morphostatic system can produce some pattern.


In general, the system is a variant of the local activation and lateral inhibition (LALI) model and doesnt need to be considered as another dynamic patterning module of newmans cathegory.},

Despite decades of research, most studies focus on only a small number of TFs and the roles of many remain unknown. RESULTS: We present a systematic characterization of spatiotemporal gene expression patterns for all known or predicted Drosophila TFs throughout embryogenesis, the first such comprehensive study for any metazoan animal. We generated RNA expression patterns for all 708 TFs by in situ hybridization, annotated the patterns using an anatomical controlled vocabulary, and analyzed TF expression in the context of organ system development. Nearly all TFs are expressed during embryogenesis and more than half are specifically expressed in the central nervous system. Compared to other genes, TFs are enriched early in the development of most organ systems, and throughout the development of the nervous system. Of the 535 TFs with spatially restricted expression, 79{\%} are dynamically expressed in multiple organ systems while 21{\%} show single-organ specificity. Of those expressed in multiple organ systems, 77 TFs are restricted to a single organ system either early or late in development. Expression patterns for 354 TFs are characterized for the first time in this study. CONCLUSIONS: We produced a reference TF dataset for the investigation of gene regulatory networks in embryogenesis, and gained insight into the expression dynamics of the full complement of TFs controlling the development of each organ system.},

They use manual annotation of the expression in 16 different tissues and classify the expression in UBiquitous, patterned (assigned to a tissue), patterned-UB, and maternal.




They compare the ratio of these categories with the rest of the genes and founf that the patterned are overrepresented (Signif) in all stages (from 4-6) except in the last one. THIS COULD BE CONTRASTED WITH OUR RESULTS AS THE RELATIVE AREA IS SIGNF LOWER IN ALL STAGES FROM THE BLASTODERM.




They make a map (for each stage) of the expression similarity between genes, that can be plotted with colors for different organs, so you can see for some stage if the genes expressed in some organ are globally similar (they would appear clustered) or not. I find this maps not very intuitive and i think that they dont provide any extra information..




some points that can be highlighted:




-Most maternal continue with zygotic (92{\%})
-More TFs are expressed in the CNS than any other organ
- 345 TFs with patterned expression are expressed in multiple organ systems at any given stage.

Non-somite mesoderm treated with Noggin generates many somites that form simultaneously, without cyclic expression of Notch-pathway genes, yet have normal size, shape and fate. These somites have axial identity: the Hox-code is fixed independently of somite fate. However they are not subdivided into rostral and caudal halves, necessary for neural segmentation.

Only ∼200-300 nm in diameter and a few micrometres long, they are separated from the cytoplasm by the ciliary neck and basal body. Often called sensory cilia, they are thought to receive chemical and mechanical stimuli and initiate specific cellular signal transduction pathways. When activated by a ligand, hedgehog pathway proteins, such as GLI2 and smoothened (SMO), translocate from the cell into the cilium. Mutations in primary ciliary proteins are associated with severe developmental defects. The ionic conditions, permeability of the primary cilia membrane, and effectiveness of the diffusion barriers between the cilia and cell body are unknown. Here we show that cilia are a unique calcium compartment regulated by a heteromeric TRP channel, PKD1L1-PKD2L1, in mice and humans. In contrast to the hypothesis that polycystin (PKD) channels initiate changes in ciliary calcium that are conducted into the cytoplasm, we show that changes in ciliary calcium concentration occur without substantially altering global cytoplasmic calcium. PKD1L1-PKD2L1 acts as a ciliary calcium channel controlling ciliary calcium concentration and thereby modifying SMO-activated GLI2 translocation and GLI1 expression.},

In jawed vertebrates (gnathostomes), the head skeleton is made of rigid three-dimensional elements connected by joints. By contrast, the head skeleton of modern jawless vertebrates (agnathans) consists of thin rods of flexible cellular cartilage, a condition thought to reflect the ancestral vertebrate state. To better understand the origin and evolution of the gnathostome head skeleton, we have been analyzing head skeleton development in the agnathan, lamprey. The fibroblast growth factors FGF3 and FGF8 have various roles during head development in jawed vertebrates, including pharyngeal pouch morphogenesis, patterning of the oral skeleton and chondrogenesis. We isolated lamprey homologs of FGF3, FGF8 and FGF receptors and asked whether these functions are ancestral features of vertebrate development or gnathostome novelties. Using gene expression and pharmacological agents, we found that proper formation of the lamprey head skeleton requires two phases of FGF signaling: an early phase during which FGFs drive pharyngeal pouch formation, and a later phase when they directly regulate skeletal differentiation and patterning. In the context of gene expression and functional studies in gnathostomes, our results suggest that these roles for FGFs arose in the first vertebrates and that the evolution of the jaw and gnathostome cellular cartilage was driven by changes developmentally downstream from pharyngeal FGF signaling.},

In this paper, I critically review the rising evidence on horizontally transferred genes and on the acquisition of novel traits in metazoans. In particular, I discuss suspected examples in sponges, cnidarians, rotifers, nematodes, molluscs and arthropods which suggest that horizontal gene transfer in metazoans is not simply a curiosity. In addition, I stress the scarcity of studies in vertebrates and other animal groups and the importance of forthcoming studies to understand the importance and extent of horizontal gene transfer in animals.},

abstract = {Variation in jaw size during evolution has been crucial for the adaptive radiation of vertebrates, yet variation in jaw size during development is often associated with disease. To test the hypothesis that early developmental events regulating neural crest (NC) progenitors contribute to species-specific differences in size, we investigated mechanisms through which two avian species, duck and quail, achieve their remarkably different jaw size. At early stages, duck exhibit an anterior shift in brain regionalization yielding a shorter, broader, midbrain. We find no significant difference in the total number of pre-migratory NC; however, duck concentrate their pre-migratory NC in the midbrain, which contributes to an increase in size of the post-migratory NC population allocated to the mandibular arch. Subsequent differences in proliferation lead to a progressive increase in size of the duck mandibular arch relative to that of quail. To test the role of pre-migratory NC progenitor number in regulating jaw size, we reduced and augmented NC progenitors. In contrast to previous reports of regeneration by NC precursors, we find that neural fold extirpation results in a loss of NC precursors. Despite this reduction in their numbers, post-migratory NC progenitors compensate, producing a symmetric and normal-sized jaw. Our results suggest that evolutionary modification of multiple aspects of NC cell biology, including NC allocation within the jaw primordia and NC-mediated proliferation, have been important to the evolution of jaw size. Furthermore, our finding of NC post-migratory compensatory mechanisms potentially extends the developmental time frame for treatments of disease or injury associated with NC progenitor loss.},

The collective movements of convergent extension drive both global reorganization of the early embryo and local remodeling during organogenesis. We report here that planar cell polarity (PCP) proteins control convergent extension by exploiting an evolutionarily ancient function of the septin cytoskeleton. By directing septin-mediated compartmentalization of cortical actomyosin, PCP proteins coordinate the specific shortening of mesenchymal cell-cell contacts, which in turn powers cell interdigitation. These data illuminate the interface between developmental signaling systems and the fundamental machinery of cell behavior and should provide insights into the etiology of human birth defects, such as spina bifida and congenital kidney cysts.},

To uncover the functional capabilities of the core "secrete-and-sense" circuit motif shared by these cells, we engineered yeast to secrete and sense the mating pheromone. Perturbing each circuit element revealed parameters that control the degree to which the cell communicated with itself versus with its neighbors. This tunable interplay of self-communication and neighbor communication enables cells to span a diverse repertoire of cellular behaviors. These include a cell being asocial by responding only to itself and social through quorum sensing, and an isogenic population of cells splitting into social and asocial subpopulations. A mathematical model explained these behaviors. The versatility of the secrete-and-sense circuit motif may explain its recurrence across species.},

In addition, the power of a given model is highly context-dependent, and the core models of developmental biology may not suffice for evo-devo questions.

abstract = {Pigment patterns of organisms have invoked strong interest from not only biologists but also, scientists in many other fields. Zebrafish is a useful model animal for studying the mechanism of pigment pattern formation. The zebrafish stripe pattern is primarily two types of pigment cells: melanophores and xanthophores. Previous studies have reported that interactions among these pigment cells are important for pattern formation. In the recent report, we found that the direct contact by xanthophores induces the membrane depolarization of melanophores. From analysis of jaguar mutants, it is suggested that the depolarization affects the movements of melanophores. To analyze the cell movement in detail, we established a unique in vitro system. It allowed us to find that WT xanthophores induced repulsive movement of melanophores through direct contact. The xanthophores also chased the melanophores. As a result, they showed run-and-chase movements. We also analyzed the cell movement of pigment cells from jaguar and leopard mutants, which have fuzzy stripes and spot patterns, respectively. jaguar cells showed inhibited run-and-chase movements, and leopard melanophores scarcely showed repulsive response. Furthermore, we paired mutant and WT cells and showed which of the melanophores and xanthophores have responsibility for the altered cell movements. These results suggested that there is a correspondence relationship between the cell movements and pigment patterns. The correspondence relationship highlighted the importance of the cell movements in the pattern formation and showed that our system is a quite useful system for future study in this field.},

abstract = {Fibroblast growth factor (Fgf) proteins are important regulators of pharyngeal arch development. Analyses of Fgf8 function in chick and mouse and Fgf3 function in zebrafish have demonstrated a role for Fgfs in the differentiation and survival of postmigratory neural crest cells (NCC) that give rise to the pharyngeal skeleton. Here we describe, in zebrafish, an earlier, essential function for Fgf8 and Fgf3 in regulating the segmentation of the pharyngeal endoderm into pouches. Using time-lapse microscopy, we show that pharyngeal pouches form by the directed lateral migration of discrete clusters of endodermal cells. In animals doubly reduced for Fgf8 and Fgf3, the migration of pharyngeal endodermal cells is disorganized and pouches fail to form. Transplantation and pharmacological experiments show that Fgf8 and Fgf3 are required in the neural keel and cranial mesoderm during early somite stages to promote first pouch formation. In addition, we show that animals doubly reduced for Fgf8 and Fgf3 have severe reductions in hyoid cartilages and the more posterior branchial cartilages. By examining early pouch and later cartilage phenotypes in individual animals hypomorphic for Fgf function, we find that alterations in pouch structure correlate with later cartilage defects. We present a model in which Fgf signaling in the mesoderm and segmented hindbrain organizes the segmentation of the pharyngeal endoderm into pouches. Moreover, we argue that the Fgf-dependent morphogenesis of the pharyngeal endoderm into pouches is critical for the later patterning of pharyngeal cartilages.},

abstract = {A prominent feature of all vertebrate embryos is the presence of a series of bulges on the lateral surface of the head, the pharyngeal arches. These structures constitute a metameric series, with each arch forming a similar set of derivatives. Significantly, the development of the pharyngeal arches is complex as it involves interactions between disparate embryonic cell types: ectoderm, endoderm, mesoderm and neural crest. It is becoming increasingly apparent that the development of the pharyngeal metamere revolves around the pharyngeal endoderm. The segmentation of this tissue is central to the generation of the arches. The pharyngeal endoderm also provides positional cues for the neural crest, and is involved in the induction of a number of components of the pharyngeal metamere. The segmentation of the pharyngeal endoderm has also been key to the evolution of pharyngeal metamerism. It is likely that endodermal segmentation is a deuterostome characteristic and that this basic pattern was sequentially modified and over time the more complex pharyngeal metamere of vertebrates emerged.},

abstract = {Tissue elongation is a fundamental component of developing and regenerating systems. Although localised proliferation is an important mechanism for tissue elongation, potentially important contributions of other elongation mechanisms, specifically cell shape change, orientated cell division and cell rearrangement, are rarely considered or quantified, particularly in mammalian systems. Their quantification, together with proliferation, provides a rigorous framework for the analysis of elongation. The mammalian palatal epithelium is a landmark-rich tissue, marked by regularly spaced ridges (rugae), making it an excellent model in which to analyse the contributions of cellular processes to directional tissue growth. We captured confocal stacks of entire fixed mouse palate epithelia throughout the mid-gestation growth period, labelled with membrane, nuclear and cell proliferation markers and segmented all cells (up to ∼20,000 per palate), allowing the quantification of cell shape and proliferation. Using the rugae as landmarks, these measures revealed that the so-called growth zone is a region of proliferation that is intermittently elevated at ruga initiation. The distribution of oriented cell division suggests that it is not a driver of tissue elongation, whereas cell shape analysis revealed that both elongation of cells leaving the growth zone and apico-basal cell rearrangements do contribute significantly to directional growth. Quantitative comparison of elongation processes indicated that proliferation contributes most to elongation at the growth zone, but cell shape change and rearrangement contribute as much as 40{\%} of total elongation. We have demonstrated the utility of an approach to analysing the cellular mechanisms underlying tissue elongation in mammalian tissues. It should be broadly applied to higher-resolution analysis of links between genotypes and malformation phenotypes.},

Sequence similarity analyses of the 502 clusters in relation to the biosynthetic function, as well as the structure of the message population at this stage, demonstrated that 390 of them were associated with functions that many kinds of cells use, 85 with cell-cell communication and 27 with transcription factors and other gene regulatory proteins. All of the 1213 clusters were subjected to whole-mount in situ hybridization to analyze the gene expression profiles at this stage. A total of 387 clusters showed expression specific to a certain tissue or organ; 149 showed epidermis-specific expression; 34 were specific to the nervous system; 29 to endoderm; 112 to mesenchyme; 32 to notochord; and 31 to muscle. Many genes were also specifically expressed in multiple tissues. The study also highlighted characteristic gene expression profiles dependent on the tissues. In addition, several genes showed intriguing expression patterns that have not been reported previously; for example, four genes were expressed specifically in the nerve cord cells and one gene was expressed only in the posterior part of muscle cells.

abstract = {The prevalence of adaptive evolution relative to genetic drift is a central problem in molecular evolution. Methods to estimate the fraction of adaptive nucleotide substitutions (alpha) have been developed, based on the McDonald-Kreitman test, that contrast polymorphism and divergence between selectively and neutrally evolving sites. However, these methods are expected to give downwardly biased estimates of alpha if there are slightly deleterious mutations, because these inflate polymorphism relative to divergence. Here, we estimate alpha by simultaneously estimating the distribution of fitness effects of new mutations at selected sites from the site frequency spectrum and the number of adaptive substitutions. We test the method using simulations. If data meet the assumptions of the analysis model, estimates of alpha show little bias, even when there is little or no recombination. However, population size differences between the divergence and polymorphism phases may cause alpha to be over or underestimated by a predictable factor that depends on the magnitude of the population size change and the shape of the distribution of effects of deleterious mutations. We analyze several data sets of protein-coding genes and noncoding regions from hominids and Drosophila. In Drosophila genes, we estimate that approximately 50{\%} of amino acid substitutions and approximately 20{\%} of substitutions in introns are adaptive. In protein-coding and noncoding data sets of humans, comparison to macaque sequences reveals little evidence for adaptive substitutions. However, the true frequency of adaptive substitutions in human-coding DNA could be as high as 40{\%}, because estimates based on current polymorphism may be strongly downwardly biased by a decrease in the effective population size along the human lineage.},

MOs were designed to complement sequence between -80 and +25 bases of the initiating AUG codons of the target mRNAs, and the specificities of many were tested by (i) designing different non-overlapping MOs directed against the same mRNA, (ii) injecting MOs differing in five bases, and (iii) performing "rescue" experiments. About 65{\%} of the MOs caused X. tropicalis embryos to develop abnormally (59{\%} of those targeted against novel genes), and we have divided the genes into "synphenotype groups," members of which cause similar loss-of-function phenotypes and that may function in the same developmental pathways. Analysis of the expression patterns of the 202 genes indicates that members of a synphenotype group are not necessarily members of the same synexpression group. This screen provides new insights into early vertebrate development and paves the way for a more comprehensive MO-based analysis of gene function in X. tropicalis.},

abstract = {Although subcellular mRNA trafficking has been demonstrated as a mechanism to control protein distribution, it is generally believed that most protein localization occurs subsequent to translation. To address this point, we developed and employed a high-resolution fluorescent in situ hybridization procedure to comprehensively evaluate mRNA localization dynamics during early Drosophila embryogenesis. Surprisingly, of the 3370 genes analyzed, 71{\%} of those expressed encode subcellularly localized mRNAs. Dozens of new and striking localization patterns were observed, implying an equivalent variety of localization mechanisms. Tight correlations between mRNA distribution and subsequent protein localization and function, indicate major roles for mRNA localization in nucleating localized cellular machineries. A searchable web resource documenting mRNA expression and localization dynamics has been established and will serve as an invaluable tool for dissecting localization mechanisms and for predicting gene functions and interactions.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The vertebrate head is a highly derived trait with a heavy concentration of sophisticated sensory organs that allow complex behaviour in this lineage. The head sensory structures arise during vertebrate development from cranial placodes and the neural crest. It is generally thought that derivatives of these ectodermal embryonic tissues played a central role in the evolutionary transition at the onset of vertebrates. Despite the obvious importance of head sensory organs for vertebrate biology, their evolutionary history is still uncertain.

RESULTS: To give a fresh perspective on the adaptive history of the vertebrate head sensory organs, we applied genomic phylostratigraphy to large-scale in situ expression data of the developing zebrafish Danio rerio. Contrary to traditional predictions, we found that dominant adaptive signals in the analyzed sensory structures largely precede the evolutionary advent of vertebrates. The leading adaptive signals at the bilaterian-chordate transition suggested that the visual system was the first sensory structure to evolve. The olfactory, vestibuloauditory, and lateral line sensory organs displayed a strong link with the urochordate-vertebrate ancestor. The only structures that qualified as genuine vertebrate innovations were the neural crest derivatives, trigeminal ganglion and adenohypophysis. We also found evidence that the cranial placodes evolved before the neural crest despite their proposed embryological relatedness.

CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our findings reveal pre-vertebrate roots and a stepwise adaptive history of the vertebrate sensory systems. This study also underscores that large genomic and expression datasets are rich sources of macroevolutionary information that can be recovered by phylostratigraphic mining.},

We chose the leaves of maples (Acer) and other tree species because they can all be visually discriminated from each other solely by leaf shape. We digitized the leaf outlines with a video camera and then examined the outlines with several morphometric methods to determine the extent to which margin details could be quantified and compared. Elliptic Fourier analysis provides complete and accurate descriptions of complex outlines and can be used to reconstruct images accurately. We compared several metrics that summarize overall shape complexity. A new measure of margin roughness is useful for quantifying and comparing margin detail independently of overall shape. Fractal dimension is highly correlated with the ratio of perimeter to area dissection index and reveals little additional information about shape. In combination, the summaries of shape complexity provide good discrimination of groups. We used canonical discriminant analysis to compare methods for outlines to traditional morphometric analysis of measurements taken between landmark points. Groups were discriminated from each other more clearly with outline methods than with landmark based analyses.},

Although some of these regulatory principles operate in prokaryotes, the combinatorial nature of the transcriptional activation process, the existence of multiprotein families, and the prevalence of heteromeric protein complexes are characteristic of eukaryotic cells and are essential for the extraordinary complexity of gene expression patterns in multicellular organisms.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Site-specific transcription factors (TFs) are coordinators of developmental and physiological gene expression programs. Their binding to cis-regulatory modules of target genes mediates the precise cell- and context-specific activation and repression of genes. The expression of TFs should therefore reflect the core expression program of each cell.

RESULTS: We studied the expression dynamics of about 750 TFs using the available genomics resources in Drosophila melanogaster. We find that 95{\%} of these TFs are expressed at some point during embryonic development, with a peak roughly between 10 and 12 hours after egg laying, the core stages of organogenesis. We address the differential utilization of DNA-binding domains in different developmental programs systematically in a spatio-temporal context, and show that the zinc finger class of TFs is predominantly early expressed, while Homeobox TFs exhibit later expression in embryogenesis.

CONCLUSIONS: Previous work, dissecting cis-regulatory modules during Drosophila development, suggests that TFs are deployed in groups acting in a cooperative manner. In contrast, we find that there is rapid exchange of co-expressed partners amongst the fly TFs, at rates similar to the genome-wide dynamics of co-expression clusters. This suggests there may also be a high level of combinatorial complexity of TFs at cis-regulatory modules.},

Docked vesicles fuse and collapse into the membrane within 30[thinsp]ms of the stimulus. Compensatory endocytosis occurs within 50 to 100[thinsp]ms at sites flanking the active zone. Invagination is blocked by inhibition of actin polymerization, and scission is blocked by inhibiting dynamin. Because intact synaptic vesicles are not recovered, this form of recycling is not compatible with kiss-and-run endocytosis; moreover, it is 200-fold faster than clathrin-mediated endocytosis. It is likely that /`ultrafast endocytosis/' is specialized to restore the surface area of the membrane rapidly.},

abstract = {Few skeletal structures are as informative of the adaptive natural history of vertebrate animals as their teeth. Understanding principles of tooth development is key to understanding evolution of the vertebrate dentition in general and emergence of multiple specialized tooth types in particular. Morphological and phylogenetic considerations suggest that crocodilians have the most primitive mode of dentition within extant tetrapods, displaying simple, conical, socketed, and continuously replaced teeth. Previous histological studies revealed several dental fates, including functional and non-functional teeth (rudiments) in the developing alligator embryos. We analyze expression of key odontogenic regulators and markers to better characterize the molecular patterning of crocodilian dentition. Importantly, we demonstrate that the morphologically distinct tooth types in Alligator mississippiensis are distinguishable by differences in their developmental programs. We also present evidence showing that tooth maturation is accompanied by dynamic gene expression in the epithelial and mesenchymal cells involved in tooth development. Our data reveal a significant morphological and genetic variation in early dental fates. We believe that this underlying developmental variation reflects modularity, or the ability of teeth to develop semi-autonomously along the alligator jaw. We propose that such modularity may have been a crucial for adaptive evolution within Amniota, allowing for the progressive modifications to tooth replacement, number, and shape.},

abstract = {In cell culture assays, Frizzled and Dfrizzled2, two members of the Frizzled family of integral membrane proteins, are able to bind Wingless and transduce the Wingless signal. To address the role of these proteins in the intact organism and to explore the question of specificity of ligand-receptor interactions in vivo, we have conducted a genetic analysis of frizzled and Dfrizzled2 in the embryo. These experiments utilize a small gamma-ray-induced deficiency that uncovers Dfrizzled2. Mutants lacking maternal frizzled and zygotic frizzled and Dfrizzled2 exhibit defects in the embryonic epidermis, CNS, heart and midgut that are indistinguishable from those observed in wingless mutants. Epidermal patterning defects in the frizzled, Dfrizzled2 double-mutant embryos can be rescued by ectopic expression of either gene. In frizzled, Dfrizzled2 mutant embryos, ectopic production of Wingless does not detectably alter the epidermal patterning defect, but ectopic production of an activated form of Armadillo produces a naked cuticle phenotype indistinguishable from that produced by ectopic production of activated Armadillo in wild-type embryos. These experiments indicate that frizzled and Dfrizzled2 function downstream of wingless and upstream of armadillo, consistent with their proposed roles as Wingless receptors. The lack of an effect on epidermal patterning of ectopic Wingless in a frizzled, Dfrizzled2 double mutant argues against the existence of additional Wingless receptors in the embryo or a model in which Frizzled and Dfrizzled2 act simply to present the ligand to its bona fide receptor. These data lead to the conclusion that Frizzled and Dfrizzled2 function as redundant Wingless receptors in multiple embryonic tissues and that this role is accurately reflected in tissue culture experiments. The redundancy of Frizzled and Dfrizzled2 explains why Wingless receptors were not identified in earlier genetic screens for mutants defective in embryonic patterning.},

We find that a small fraction of the total Sdf1 pool is available to signal and induces a linear Sdf1-signaling gradient across the primordium. This signaling gradient is initiated at the rear of the primordium, equilibrates across the primordium within 200 min, and operates near steady state. The rear of the primordium generates this gradient through continuous sequestration of Sdf1 protein by the alternate Sdf1-receptor Cxcr7. Modeling shows that this is a physically plausible scenario.},

As a result, non-reproductive workers are all inter-lineage hybrids, whereas the sexual line is purely maternal.

Remarkably, workers are hybrids of the same two genetic lineages along a 400 km transect crossing the whole distribution range of the species. These results indicate that social hybridogenesis in C. hispanica allows their maintenance over time and across a large geographical scale of two highly divergent genetic lineages, despite their constant hybridization.

abstract = {In a large-scale gene expression screen 1765 randomly picked cDNAs were analyzed by whole-mount in situ hybridization in Xenopus embryos. Two hundred and seventy three unique, differentially expressed genes were identified, 204 of which are novel in Xenopus. Partial DNA sequences and expression patterns were documented and assembled into a database, `AXelDB'. Approximately 30{\%} of cDNAs analyzed represent differentially expressed genes and about 5{\%} show highly regionalized expression. Novel marker genes and potential developmental regulators were found. Differential expression of mitochondrial genes was observed. Marker genes were used to study regionalization of the entire gastrula as well as the tail forming region and the epidermis of the tailbud embryo. Four `synexpression' groups representing genes with shared, complex expression pattern that predict molecular pathways involved in patterning and differentiation were identified. According to their probable functional significance these groups are designated as Delta1, Bmp4, ER-import and Chromatin group. Within synexpression groups, a likely function of genes without sequence similarity can be predicted. The results indicate that synexpression groups have strong prognostic value. A cluster analysis was made by comparing gene expression patterns to derive a novel parameter, `tissue relatedness'. In conclusion, this study describes a semi-functional approach to investigate genes expressed during early development and provides global insight into embryonic patterning.},

abstract = {Concepts act as a cornerstone of human cognition. Humans and non-human primates learn conceptual relationships such as  same',  different',  larger than',  better than', among others. In all cases, the relationships have to be encoded by the brain independently of the physical nature of objects linked by the relation. Consequently, concepts are associated with high levels of cognitive sophistication and are not expected in an insect brain. Yet, various works have shown that the miniature brain of honeybees rapidly learns conceptual relationships involving visual stimuli. Concepts such as  same',  different',  above/below of' or  left/right are well mastered by bees. We review here evidence about concept learning in honeybees and discuss both its potential adaptive advantage and its possible neural substrates. The results reviewed here challenge the traditional view attributing supremacy to larger brains when it comes to the elaboration of concepts and have wide implications for understanding how brains can form conceptual relations.},

it seems that the capacity of conceptual learning is based on the multi-modal neurons on the mushroom body, that can integrate information on sensory information, different from drosophila than is unimodal and is not capable of integration.},

abstract = {The metameric organization of the Drosophila embryo is generated in the first 5 h after fertilization. An initially rather simple pattern provides the foundation for subsequent development and diversification of the segmented part of the body. Many of the genes that control the formation of this pattern have been identified and at least twenty have been cloned. By combining the techniques of genetics, molecular biology and experimental embryology, it is becoming possible to unravel the role played by each of these genes. The repeating segment pattern is defined by the persistent expression of engrailed and of other genes of the 'segment polarity' class. The establishment of this pattern is directed by a transient molecular prepattern that is generated in the blastoderm by the activity of the 'pair-rule' genes. Maternal determinants at the poles of the egg coordinate this prepattern and define the anteroposterior sequence of pattern elements. The primary effect of these determinants is not known, but genes required for their production have been identified and the product of one of these, bicoid is known to be localized at the anterior of the egg. One early consequence of their activity is to define domains along the A-P axis within which a series of 'cardinal' genes are transcribed. The activity of the cardinal genes is required both to coordinate the process of segmentation and to define the early domains of homeotic gene expression. Further interactions between the homeotic genes and other classes of segmentation genes refine the initial establishment of segment identities.},

@article{Hopwood2007,
abstract = {Developmental biology is today unimaginable without the normal stages that define standard divisions of development. This history of normal stages, and the related normal plates and normal tables, shows how these standards have shaped and been shaped by disciplinary change in vertebrate embryology. The article highlights the Normal Plates of the Development of the Vertebrates edited by the German anatomist Franz Keibel (16 volumes, 1897-1938). These were a major response to problems in the relations between ontogeny and phylogeny that amounted in practical terms to a crisis in staging embryos, not just between, but (for some) also within species. Keibel's design adapted a plate by Wilhelm His and tables by Albert Oppel in order to go beyond the already controversial comparative plates of the Darwinist propagandist Ernst Haeckel. The project responded to local pressures, including intense concern with individual variation, but recruited internationally and mapped an embryological empire. Though theoretically inconclusive, the plates became standard laboratory tools and forged a network within which the Institut International d'Embryologie (today the International Society of Developmental Biologists) was founded in 1911. After World War I, experimentalists, led by Ross Harrison and Viktor Hamburger, and human embryologists, especially George Streeter at the Carnegie Department of Embryology, transformed Keibel's complex, bulky tomes to suit their own contrasting demands. In developmental biology after World War II, normal stages-reduced to a few journal pages-helped domesticate model organisms. Staging systems had emerged from discussions that questioned the very possibility of assigning an embryo to a stage. The historical issues resonate today as developmental biologists work to improve and extend stage series, to make results from different laboratories easier to compare and to take individual variation into account.},

We find that these steps of villification depend on the sequential differentiation of the distinct smooth muscle layers of the gut, which restrict the expansion of the growing endoderm and mesenchyme, generating compressive stresses that lead to their buckling and folding. A quantitative computational model, incorporating measured properties of the developing gut, recapitulates the morphological patterns seen during villification in a variety of species. These results provide a mechanistic understanding of the formation of these elaborations of the lining of the gut, essential for providing sufficient surface area for nutrient absorption.},

abstract = {The rapid cleavage stage of early sea urchin development is characterized by the transient synthesis of a specific set of proteins. These proteins were identified by comparing the pattern of newly synthesized proteins from fully grown sea urchin oocytes, unfertilized and fertilized eggs, several embryonic stages, and adult tissues by one- and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. We found that, in contrast to fertilization, meiotic maturation results in major changes in the relative amounts and types of proteins synthesized. The synthesis of many proteins in the oocyte, including actin, tubulin, and other proteins which have accumulated during oogenesis, appears to be greatly reduced or eliminated in the unfertilized and newly fertilized egg. An examination of the proteins synthesized in unfertilized and fertilized eggs reveals several proteins that are synthesized only during this phase of development and may be required for the rapid cell divisions which occur during this period. At the midblastula stage, when the cell-doubling time shows down, the pattern of synthesis changes to resemble that of the oocyte. These results imply that many of the changes in the pattern of protein synthesis seen around the blastula stage may be associated with the return of the cell cycle to a normal length rather than synthetic changes associated with differentiation.},

No change in synthesis patterns during progesterone-induced oocyte maturation was detected. In oocytes matured in vivo (unfertilized eggs), however, the synthesis of several oogenetic proteins ceased, only to be resumed later in development. At fertilization, one novel non-oogenetic protein was found. A cleavage-specific protein was also detected. Dramatic changes in protein synthesis patterns were detected at gastrulation in axolotl embryos. About 10{\%} of the proteins synthesized at earlier stages ceased synthesis at gastrulation. Another 10{\%} of the proteins synthesized during gastrulation were novel. A gastrulation-specific protein was also detected. After gastrulation additional novel non-oogenetic proteins were synthesized for most stages examined. A pronounced increase in the number of novel proteins synthesized was observed at the onset of neurulation and during neural fold fusion. Some of those proteins were specific to dorsal or axial structure tissue (AST) and some were specific to ventral or non-axial structure tissue (NAST). Actin and tubulin synthesis was also monitored during axolotl development. While the cytoplasmic gamma- and beta-actins were synthesized at all stages, muscle-specific alpha-actin synthesis began at the head-process stage (stage 23/25).},

@article{Ballantine1979,
abstract = {Patterns of protein synthesis during the development of Xenopus were studied by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Up to the end of the blastula stage we find no newly synthesized proteins which are not already made in the oocyte. The first new proteins are seen during gastrulation, and they increase in number during neurulation. Some of these are restricted to the 'ectodermal' region, and some to the 'endodermal' region of embryos divided into two parts. These new, region-specific proteins include alpha-actin. When the oocyte matures the number of detectable newly synthesized proteins decreases, reaching a minimum in the unfertilized egg. Some, such as beta- and gamma-actin, re-appear at the end of cleavage. This could not be shown to be a recovery artifact. The relation of the total mRNA to these changes in protein synthesis was studied by translation in the lysed reticulocyte cell-free system. The mRNAs that code for oocyte proteins that cease synthesis in the unfertilized egg and re-appear in blastulae are nevertheless detectable in total RNA made from eggs. These proteins therefore seem to cease and resume synthesis through translational control. mRNAs for new proteins first appear after gastrulation, just when these proteins are first detected in vivo. This strongly suggests, though it does not prove, that new gene activity is involved. It is therefore likely that region-specific gene activity is already present by the gastrula stage of development, and has an impact on the most abundant kinds of proteins made in the embryo.},

These networks begin with broad positional information that patterns the cells of the early embryo, and end with precise expression profiles that provide the functions of fully differentiated cells. At the heart of these networks are cis-regulatory modules (CRMs), which contain binding sites for regulatory proteins and control the spatial and temporal expression of genes within the network. Recent studies in several model systems have begun to decipher the 'cis-regulatory codes' of CRMs involved in various developmental processes. These studies suggest that CRMs involved in regulating co-expressed genes share sequence characteristics that can be identified by in silico approaches. They also suggest that CRMs involved in specific types of developmental events have common binding site architectures, which can be linked to their specific functions.},

abstract = {Multicellularity has evolved in several eukaryotic lineages leading to plants, fungi, and animals. Theoretically, in each case, this involved (1) cell-to-cell adhesion with an alignment-of-fitness among cells, (2) cell-to-cell communication, cooperation, and specialization with an export-of-fitness to a multicellular organism, and (3) in some cases, a transition from "simple" to "complex" multicellularity. When mapped onto a matrix of morphologies based on developmental and physical rules for plants, these three phases help to identify a "unicellular ⇒ colonial ⇒ filamentous (unbranched ⇒ branched) ⇒ pseudoparenchymatous ⇒ parenchymatous" morphological transformation series that is consistent with trends observed within each of the three major plant clades. In contrast, a more direct "unicellular ⇒ colonial or siphonous ⇒ parenchymatous" series is observed in fungal and animal lineages. In these contexts, we discuss the roles played by the cooptation, expansion, and subsequent diversification of ancestral genomic toolkits and patterning modules during the evolution of multicellularity. We conclude that the extent to which multicellularity is achieved using the same toolkits and modules (and thus the extent to which multicellularity is homologous among different organisms) differs among clades and even among some closely related lineages.},

abstract = {This paper describes a computational approach to edge detection. The success of the approach depends on the definition of a comprehensive set of goals for the computation of edge points. These goals must be precise enough to delimit the desired behavior of the detector while making minimal assumptions about the form of the solution. We define detection and localization criteria for a class of edges, and present mathematical forms for these criteria as functionals on the operator impulse response. A third criterion is then added to ensure that the detector has only one response to a single edge. We use the criteria in numerical optimization to derive detectors for several common image features, including step edges. On specializing the analysis to step edges, we find that there is a natural uncertainty principle between detection and localization performance, which are the two main goals. With this principle we derive a single operator shape which is optimal at any scale. The optimal detector has a simple approximate implementation in which edges are marked at maxima in gradient magnitude of a Gaussian-smoothed image. We extend this simple detector using operators of several widths to cope with different signal-to-noise ratios in the image. We present a general method, called feature synthesis, for the fine-to-coarse integration of information from operators at different scales. Finally we show that step edge detector performance improves considerably as the operator point spread function is extended along the edge.},

BACKGROUND:Cell-fate specification and tissue differentiation during development are largely achieved by the regulation of gene transcription.RESULTS:As a first step to creating a comprehensive atlas of gene-expression patterns during Drosophila embryogenesis, we examined 2,179 genes by in situ hybridization to fixed Drosophila embryos. Of the genes assayed, 63.7{\%} displayed dynamic expression patterns that were documented with 25,690 digital photomicrographs of individual embryos. The photomicrographs were annotated using controlled vocabularies for anatomical structures that are organized into a developmental hierarchy. We also generated a detailed time course of gene expression during embryogenesis using microarrays to provide an independent corroboration of the in situ hybridization results. All image, annotation and microarray data are stored in publicly available database. We found that the RNA transcripts of about 1{\%} of genes show clear subcellular localization. Nearly all the annotated expression patterns are distinct. We present an approach for organizing the data by hierarchical clustering of annotation terms that allows us to group tissues that express similar sets of genes as well as genes displaying similar expression patterns.CONCLUSIONS:Analyzing gene-expression patterns by in situ hybridization to whole-mount embryos provides an extremely rich dataset that can be used to identify genes involved in developmental processes that have been missed by traditional genetic analysis. Systematic analysis of rigorously annotated patterns of gene expression will complement and extend the types of analyses carried out using expression microarrays.},

abstract = {In the major animal model species like mouse, fish or fly, detailed spatial information on gene expression over time can be acquired through whole mount in situ hybridization experiments. In these species, expression patterns of many genes have been studied and data has been integrated into dedicated model organism databases like ZFIN for zebrafish, MEPD for medaka, BDGP for Drosophila or GXD for mouse. However, a central repository that allows users to query and compare gene expression patterns across different species has not yet been established. Therefore, we have integrated expression patterns for zebrafish, Drosophila, medaka and mouse into a central public repository called 4DXpress (expression database in four dimensions). Users can query anatomy ontology-based expression annotations across species and quickly jump from one gene to the orthologues in other species. Genes are linked to public microarray data in ArrayExpress. We have mapped developmental stages between the species to be able to compare developmental time phases. We store the largest collection of gene expression patterns available to date in an individual resource, reflecting 16 505 annotated genes. 4DXpress will be an invaluable tool for developmental as well as for computational biologists interested in gene regulation and evolution. 4DXpress is available at http://ani.embl.de/4DXpress.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cell and tissue specific gene expression is a defining feature of embryonic development in multi-cellular organisms. However, the range of gene expression patterns, the extent of the correlation of expression with function, and the classes of genes whose spatial expression are tightly regulated have been unclear due to the lack of an unbiased, genome-wide survey of gene expression patterns.

RESULTS: We determined and documented embryonic expression patterns for 6,003 (44{\%}) of the 13,659 protein-coding genes identified in the Drosophila melanogaster genome with over 70,000 images and controlled vocabulary annotations. Individual expression patterns are extraordinarily diverse, but by supplementing qualitative in situ hybridization data with quantitative microarray time-course data using a hybrid clustering strategy, we identify groups of genes with similar expression. Of 4,496 genes with detectable expression in the embryo, 2,549 (57{\%}) fall into 10 clusters representing broad expression patterns. The remaining 1,947 (43{\%}) genes fall into 29 clusters representing restricted expression, 20{\%} patterned as early as blastoderm, with the majority restricted to differentiated cell types, such as epithelia, nervous system, or muscle. We investigate the relationship between expression clusters and known molecular and cellular-physiological functions.

CONCLUSION: Nearly 60{\%} of the genes with detectable expression exhibit broad patterns reflecting quantitative rather than qualitative differences between tissues. The other 40{\%} show tissue-restricted expression; the expression patterns of over 1,500 of these genes are documented here for the first time. Within each of these categories, we identified clusters of genes associated with particular cellular and developmental functions.},

This view is consistent with von Baer's observations of morphological divergence at late stages. It is also suggested by the conserved morphology and common molecular genetic mechanisms of pattern formation seen in embryos. I argue here, however, that differences in adult morphology may be generated at a variety of stages. Natural selection may have a major action on developmental mechanisms during the organogenetic period, because this is when many adult traits are specified. Evolutionary changes in these early developmental mechanisms probably include subtle shifts in the timing of gene expression. Changes of this kind have little or no gross effect on the anatomy of the embryo; they are only phenotypically expressed, or readily detected, when amplified at later stages. The phylotypic stage, the developmental hourglass, modularity, and von Baerian divergence are reassessed in terms of these arguments.},

abstract = {During embryonic development, a complex organism is formed from a single starting cell. These processes of growth and differentiation are driven by large transcriptional changes, which are following the expression and activity of transcription factors (TFs). This study sought to compare TF expression during embryonic development in a diverse group of metazoan animals: representatives of vertebrates (Danio rerio, Xenopus tropicalis), a chordate (Ciona intestinalis) and invertebrate phyla such as insects (Drosophila melanogaster, Anopheles gambiae) and nematodes (Caenorhabditis elegans) were sampled, The different species showed overall very similar TF expression patterns, with TF expression increasing during the initial stages of development. C2H2 zinc finger TFs were over-represented and Homeobox TFs were under-represented in the early stages in all species. We further clustered TFs for each species based on their quantitative temporal expression profiles. This showed very similar TF expression trends in development in vertebrate and insect species. However, analysis of the expression of orthologous pairs between more closely related species showed that expression of most individual TFs is not conserved, following the general model of duplication and diversification. The degree of similarity between TF expression between Xenopus tropicalis and Danio rerio followed the hourglass model, with the greatest similarity occuring during the early tailbud stage in Xenopus tropicalis and the late segmentation stage in Danio rerio. However, for Drosophila melanogaster and Anopheles gambiae there were two periods of high TF transcriptome similarity, one during the Arthropod phylotypic stage at 8-10 hours into Drosophila development and the other later at 16-18 hours into Drosophila development.},

They separate the TF in groups (ZF,HLH, Homeobox) and find than in general the ZF C2H2 are over-represented at the beginning; In almost all (not in c elegans) the homeobox is under-rep at the beg, and over-rep at the onset of gastrulation.

They found that is hourglass like in vertebrates, with the minimun distance in early TB-late segmentation in xenopus and danio.


between Drosophila-Anopheles the most similar is the stage between 16-18 hours, in contrast with the 6-8 hours found between drosophilas (Kalinka 2012), for non-TF it appears to be that stage between droso and anopheles but they dont show the data.},

Yet gene expression patterns have not been described throughout vertebrate embryogenesis. This study presents statistical analyses of gene expression during all 40 developmental stages in the teleost Fundulus heteroclitus using four biological replicates per stage. RESULTS: Patterns of gene expression for 7,000 genes appear to be important as they recapitulate developmental timing. Among the 45{\%} of genes with significant expression differences between pairs of temporally adjacent stages, significant differences in gene expression vary from as few as five to more than 660. Five adjacent stages have disproportionately more significant changes in gene expression ({\textgreater} 200 genes) relative to other stages: four to eight and eight to sixteen cell stages, onset of circulation, pre and post-hatch, and during complete yolk absorption. The fewest differences among adjacent stages occur during gastrulation. Yet, at stage 16, (pre-mid-gastrulation) the largest number of genes has peak expression. This stage has an over representation of genes in oxidative respiration and protein expression (ribosomes, translational genes and proteases). Unexpectedly, among all ribosomal genes, both strong positive and negative correlations occur. Similar correlated patterns of expression occur among all significant genes. CONCLUSIONS: These data provide statistical support for the temporal dynamics of developmental gene expression during all stages of vertebrate development.},

By contrast, this article attempts to use this broad knowledge base to arrive at a classification of developmental types through which metazoan body plans are generated. This classification scheme pays particular attention to the diverse ways by which cell signalling and morphogenetic movements depend on each other, and leads to several testable hypotheses regarding morphological variation within and between species, as well as metazoan evolution.},
annote = {He proposes a classification of developmental types based on the organization of development in terms of the interdependencies of signalling and morphogenetic events.


The types are:
Type A: nematodes, spiralians and some small phyla
Type B: cnidarians
Type C: short-germ-band segmentation and sequentially segmenting arthropods
Type D: long-germ-band insects
Type E: vertebrates


Each type is defined in terms of the relative use of sinalling and morphogenetic events through development, and the variation along development (depicted in fig 3).


the specific hypothesis in this article are:


I. there seems to be an association between developmental type and some aspects of the body plan (size, cell types, complexity, organs from one or more populations of cells.
II.species with the same type of development exhibit commonalities in morphological variation and in the genotype-phenotype maps that they produce (A-{\textgreater}simple GPmap, gradual variation; E {\textgreater} C,D {\textgreater} A,B -{\textgreater} more variation within species, more complez GPmap):
III.different types of development correlate with different amounts of variation at different stages of development (summarized in fig 3; A and possibly B wouldnt follow an hourgalss model; C,D,E will follow an hourglass model.
IV.complex body plans have evolved owing to a gradual transition towards developmental types with a higher interdependence between cell signalling and morphogenesis (E didnt evolve because of adaptive advantage but because it is a simpler way to produce larger and more complex body plans).


This classification is similar to Davidson's (1991) but in Davidson's type C and D are only one type, and E and B also. Here both cases are separated because of the more morphostatic mechanisms in D, and the strong morphodynamic mechanisms in E, respectively.},

abstract = {Despite the large size of the Xenopus laevis egg (approximately 1.2 mm diameter), a fertilized egg rapidly proceeds through mitosis in a spatially coordinated fashion. Mitosis is initiated by a bistable system of regulatory proteins centred on Cdk1 (refs 1, 2), raising the possibility that this spatial coordination could be achieved through trigger waves of Cdk1 activity. Using an extract system that performs cell cycles in vitro, here we show that mitosis does spread through Xenopus cytoplasm via trigger waves, propagating at a linear speed of approximately 60 µm min(-1). Perturbing the feedback loops that give rise to the bistability of Cdk1 changes the speed and dynamics of the waves. Time-lapse imaging of intact eggs argues that trigger waves of Cdk1 activation are responsible for surface contraction waves, ripples in the cell cortex that precede cytokinesis. These findings indicate that Cdk1 trigger waves help ensure the spatiotemporal coordination of mitosis in large eggs. Trigger waves may be an important general mechanism for coordinating biochemical events over large distances.},
annote = {they show that the mitotic entry in xenopus embryo follows a mitotic trigger wave.
It was already thought that diffusion couldn{\&}{\#}039;t account for this process, because the embryo is too big.
The process is based in bi-stable system of Cdk1 kinase activity. There are stable low (interphase) and stable high (mitotic) Cdk1 activity; an intermediate level of Cdk1 activity would be attracted to the mitotic steady state.

        
"To see why bistability can generate rapidly propagating trigger waves, imagine a long thin tube containing cytoplasm with a uniform concentration of cyclin B1 and Cdk1, and assume that in some region of the tube the cytoplasm is in the mitotic, high Cdk1-activity state (Fig. 1c, red) while the rest of the cytoplasm is in the interphase, low Cdk1-activity state (Fig. 1c, blue). Within some small distance of the interface, the cytoplasm will rapidly mix by diffusion, resulting in an intermediate level of Cdk1 activity. If this activity is above the unstable steady state (Fig. 1b, white point), this slice of cytoplasm will flip to the mitotic state."},

The theoretical framework based on DPMs originally postulated that each module generates a key morphological motif of the basic animal body plans and organ forms. Here, we use a previous definition of the plant multicellular body plan and describe the basic DPMs underlying the main features of plant development. For each DPM, we identify characteristic molecules and molecular networks, and when possible, the physical processes they mobilize. We then briefly review the phyletic distribution of these molecules across the various plant lineages. Although many of the basic plant DPMs are significantly different from those of animals, the framework established by a DPM perspective on plant development is essential for comparative analyses aiming to provide a truly mechanistic explanation for organic development across all plant and animal lineages.},
annote = {They try to apply the DPM approach of Newman and Bates (2009) to plants.

        
They describe some DPMs that they argue would have been important in the evolution of plants, some are similar to the ones in animals as Adhesion, Polarity.. and i think they could have included Lateral inhibition (as such, they mentioned in the "spatially dependent differentiation" DPM) and differential growth (they mention dff growth and it is a DPM in the original paper but they dont include it here); and there are some that seem to be "made-up", because they dont really are described from the physical process thay underlay them but more on the final outcome, as buds or leaves. In this case it seems that this modules are just the combination of oher, like lateral inhibition and differential growth.

        
Then they make some conclusions about how the moderm phenotypes are product of canalization of these DPM{\&}{\#}039;s, but that they are not that integrated as in animals, which make plants more plastic and adaptive in changing environments.. all this is very difficult if not imposible to test and prove .},

abstract = {Studies of chimeras and in vivo development demonstrate that cell lineages are often quite variable, apparently in response to chance perturbations. This points to an apparent contradiction: although individual cells are the units of genetic information and differentiation, not all cellular events need be precise for the development of functional organisms. The social organization of ants can serve as a metaphor that helps understand the mechanisms that underlie such development. Ants suggest that continued cellular interactions and environmental conditions could specify the proportion and general location of specialized units. Leaf venation is used as a concrete example of this general principle. A signal produced continuously by all cells specifies a requirement for vein differentiation. The cells that respond by differentiation then transport the signal away from the leaf; this removal acting as a feedback indicating that the requirement is being met. Because transport increases during vein differentiation, early initiation occurs in excess and vein 'competition' for the signal assures an acceptable outcome. Such specification would be robust since it does not depend on events in any single cell, and chance events, rather than being corrected or reversed, may be built upon in reaching an expected, collective phenotype. The absence of detailed information preceding development distinguishes this hypothesis from the common alternatives of a program or blueprint. Collective specification would have important implications for developmental plasticity and evolution.},

abstract = {Evolution involves interplay between natural selection and developmental constraints. This is seen, for example, when digits are lost from the limbs during evolution. Extant archosaurs (crocodiles and birds) show several instances of digit loss under different selective regimes, and show limbs with one, two, three, four or the ancestral number of five digits. The 'lost' digits sometimes persist for millions of years as developmental vestiges. Here we examine digit loss in the Nile crocodile and five birds, using markers of three successive stages of digit development. In two independent lineages under different selection, wing digit I and all its markers disappear. In contrast, hindlimb digit V persists in all species sampled, both as cartilage, and as Sox9- expressing precartilage domains, 250 million years after the adult digit disappeared. There is therefore a mismatch between evolution of the embryonic and adult phenotypes. All limbs, regardless of digit number, showed similar expression of sonic hedgehog (Shh). Even in the one-fingered emu wing, expression of posterior genes Hoxd11 and Hoxd12 was conserved, whereas expression of anterior genes Gli3 and Alx4 was not. We suggest that the persistence of digit V in the embryo may reflect constraints, particularly the conserved posterior gene networks associated with the zone of polarizing activity (ZPA). The more rapid and complete disappearance of digit I may reflect its ZPA-independent specification, and hence, weaker developmental constraints. Interacting with these constraints are selection pressures for limb functions such as flying and perching. This model may help to explain the diverse patterns of digit loss in tetrapods. Our study may also help to understand how selection on adults leads to changes in development.},

Static structures such as crystals often form through simple energy minimization, whereas dynamic ones require continuous energy input to grow and sustain. Dynamic systems are ubiquitous in nature and biology but have proven challenging to understand and engineer. Here, we bridge the gap from static to dynamic self-assembly by introducing a model system based on ferrofluid droplets on superhydrophobic surfaces. The droplets self-assemble under a static external magnetic field into simple patterns that can be switched to complicated dynamic dissipative structures by applying a time-varying magnetic field. The transition between the static and dynamic patterns involves kinetic trapping and shows complexity that can be directly visualized.},

Thanks to recent progress in genomics and imaging technologies, systemic approaches are now used in parallel with small-scale studies to establish links between genomic information and phenotypes, often described at the subcellular level. Current model organism databases, however, do not integrate heterogeneous data sets at different scales into a global view of the developmental program. Here, we present a novel, generic digital system, NISEED, and its implementation, ANISEED, to ascidians, which are invertebrate chordates suitable for developmental systems biology approaches. ANISEED hosts an unprecedented combination of anatomical and molecular data on ascidian development. This includes the first detailed anatomical ontologies for these embryos, and quantitative geometrical descriptions of developing cells obtained from reconstructed three-dimensional (3D) embryos up to the gastrula stages. Fully annotated gene model sets are linked to 30,000 high-resolution spatial gene expression patterns in wild-type and experimentally manipulated conditions and to 528 experimentally validated cis-regulatory regions imported from specialized databases or extracted from 160 literature articles. This highly structured data set can be explored via a Developmental Browser, a Genome Browser, and a 3D Virtual Embryo module. We show how integration of heterogeneous data in ANISEED can provide a system-level understanding of the developmental program through the automatic inference of gene regulatory interactions, the identification of inducing signals, and the discovery and explanation of novel asymmetric divisions.},

abstract = {Little is known about the ancient chordates that gave rise to the first vertebrates, but the descendants of other invertebrate chordates extant at the time still flourish in the ocean. These invertebrates include the cephalochordates and tunicates, whose larvae share with vertebrate embryos a common body plan with a central notochord and a dorsal nerve cord. Tunicates are now thought to be the sister group of vertebrates. However, research based on several species of ascidians, a diverse and wide-spread class of tunicates, revealed that the molecular strategies underlying their development appear to diverge greatly from those found in vertebrates. Furthermore, the adult body plan of most tunicates, which arises following an extensive post-larval metamorphosis, shows little resemblance to the body plan of any other chordate. In this review, we compare the developmental strategies of ascidians and vertebrates and argue that the very divergence of these strategies reveals the surprising level of plasticity of the chordate developmental program and is a rich resource to identify core regulatory mechanisms that are evolutionarily conserved in chordates. Further, we propose that the comparative analysis of the architecture of ascidian and vertebrate gene regulatory networks may provide critical insight into the origin of the chordate body plan.},

abstract = {Setting up future body axes is the first important event before and at the beginning of embryogenesis. The ascidian embryo is a classic model that has been used to gain insight into developmental processes for over a century. This review summarizes advances made in this decade in our understanding of the developmental processes involved in the specification of the embryonic axes and cell fates during early ascidian embryogenesis. Maternal factors, including mRNAs, are translocated to specific regions of the egg by cytoplasmic and cortical reorganization, so-called ooplasmic segregation, and specify the animal-vegetal axis and the one perpendicular to it, which is defined as the anteroposterior axis in ascidians. Some postplasmic/PEM RNAs that are anchored to cortical endoplasmic reticulum are brought to the future posterior pole of fertilized eggs, and play crucial roles in posterior development. Following specification of the animal-vegetal axis, nuclear localization of beta-catenin takes place in the vegetal blastomeres; this occurrence is important for the acquisition of the vegetal character of the blastomeres in later development. Positioning of these maternal factors lead to subsequent cell interactions and zygotic gene expression responsible for axis establishment and for cell fate specification. We describe how endoderm blastomeres in the vegetal pole region emanate inductive signals mainly attributable to fibroblast growth factor. Marginal blastomeres next to endoderm blastomeres respond differently in ways that are determined by intrinsic competence factors. Expression patterns of developmentally important genes, including key transcription factors of each tissue type, are also summarized.},

After fertilization, the cortex betwork contracts segregating microfilaments, mitochondria, cortical endoplasmatic reticulum and maternal RNAs to the vegetal pole.


Then depending on the the sperm entry, there is a second cortical reorganization that brings most of this components to the future posterior pole. This second phase of segregation to the Posterior Vegetal Cortex(PVC), produces the centrosome acting body (CAB), that is necessary for the unequal cleavage on the vegetal pole (3 times, always the smaller daughters keep the CAB).

In this study, to understand comprehensively the anatomy of the tailbud embryo at single-cell-level, real microscopic image stacks of the tailbud embryo in Ciona intestinalis were reconstructed into a 3D computer model. This comprehensive 3D model of the ascidian tailbud embryo was based on real images of confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) and therefore, cell shape, location and cell arrangement reflect real geometries of the tailbud embryo. We found that the tailbud embryo consists of 1579 cells, including 836 epidermal cells, 228 cells in the central nervous system, 218 mesenchymal cells, four trunk ventral cells, two B/B(⁎)8.11 cells, 36 muscle cells, 40 notochord cells, four primordial germ cells, and 199 endodermal cells. Moreover, we identified for the first time two populations of previously undefined cells (a total of 12 cells) in Ciona: one located in the lateral trunk and the other located under the tail dorsal epidermis.

abstract = {We have undertaken a large-scale microarray gene expression analysis using cDNAs corresponding to 21,000 Xenopus laevis ESTs. mRNAs from 37 samples, including embryos and adult organs, were profiled. Cluster analysis of embryos of different stages was carried out and revealed expected affinities between gastrulae and neurulae, as well as between advanced neurulae and tadpoles, while egg and feeding larvae were clearly separated. Cluster analysis of adult organs showed some unexpected tissue-relatedness, e.g. kidney is more related to endodermal than to mesodermal tissues and the brain is separated from other neuroectodermal derivatives. Cluster analysis of genes revealed major phases of co-ordinate gene expression between egg and adult stages. During the maternal-early embryonic phase, genes maintaining a rapidly dividing cell state are predominantly expressed (cell cycle regulators, chromatin proteins). Genes involved in protein biosynthesis are progressively induced from mid-embryogenesis onwards. The larval-adult phase is characterised by expression of genes involved in metabolism and terminal differentiation. Thirteen potential synexpression groups were identified, which encompass components of diverse molecular processes or supra-molecular structures, including chromatin, RNA processing and nucleolar function, cell cycle, respiratory chain/Krebs cycle, protein biosynthesis, endoplasmic reticulum, vesicle transport, synaptic vesicle, microtubule, intermediate filament, epithelial proteins and collagen. Data filtering identified genes with potential stage-, region- and organ-specific expression. The dataset was assembled in the iChip microarray database, , which allows user-defined queries.

In the present study, we systematically identified and characterized 566 zinc finger genes in the genome of Ciona intestinalis, an emerging model system for genome-wide studies of development and evolution. Of these genes, 356 genes encoded a potential transcription factor based on putative nucleic acid binding activity or domains of unknown function. We further examined the expression patterns of 225 genes during embryogenesis, and, when considered with a previous study [Imai, K.S., Hino, K., Yagi, K., Satoh, N., Satou, Y., 2004. Gene expression profiles of transcription factors and signaling molecules in the ascidian embryo: towards a comprehensive understanding of gene networks. Development 131, 4047-4058], we have characterized the developmental expression patterns of nearly 85{\%} of the potential zinc finger-containing transcription factors. Overall, zinc finger genes are preferentially maternally expressed with little larval expression during development. The present study provides a valuable reference for genome-wide studies in this species and for future studies wishing to examine zinc finger gene expression patterns in other animals.},

abstract = {Achieving a real understanding of animal development obviously requires a comprehensive rather than partial identification of the genes working in each developmental process. Recent decoding of genome sequences will enable us to perform such studies. An ascidian, Ciona intestinalis, one of the animals whose genome has been sequenced, is a chordate sharing a basic body plan with vertebrates, although its genome contains less paralogs than are usually seen in vertebrates. In the present study, we discuss the genomewide approach to networks of developmental genes in Ciona embryos. We focus on transcription factor genes and some major groups of signal transduction genes. These genes are comprehensively listed and examined with regard to their embryonic expression by in situ hybridization (http://ghost.zool.kyoto-u.ac.jp/tfst.html). The results revealed that 74{\%} of the transcription factor genes are expressed maternally and that 56{\%} of the genes are zygotically expressed during embryogenesis. Of these, 34{\%} of the transcription factor genes are expressed both maternally and zygotically. The number of zygotically expressed transcription factor genes increases gradually during embryogenesis. As an example, and taking advantage of this comprehensive description of gene expression profiles, we identified transcription factor genes and signal transduction genes that are expressed at the early gastrula stage and that work downstream of beta-catenin, FoxD and/or Fgf9/16/20. Because these three genes are essential for ascidian endomesoderm specification, transcription factor genes and signal transduction genes involved in each of the downstream processes can be deduced comprehensively using the present approach.},
annote = {-----SUMMARY-----------------------------------
It makes a transcriptional analysis of the genes expressed in Ciona intestinalis development. Is for the GHOST database.

Until stage 110, they describe genes at cellular level!

they found that at the 110cells (when all the blastomers are specified, only 65 TF are zygotically expressed!! 
65 TF required for specification
---METHODS--------------------------
they use cDNA from their own collection, and some PCR amplified for some genes not in the library.
genes prediction from genome and proteome of 
ciona , and homologues with human.--

------ MORE DETAILED -------------------------------

They focus on Transcriptional Factors, "signaling molecules" (RTKs like FGFR, MAPK, Notch, Wnt, TGFB, HH, JAK/STAT). 
They found that the majority of the genes are expressed already in the maternal stages (74{\%} of TF, 76{\%} signal). This implies a strong morphostatic mechanism, only 64 zygotic TF are required to specify further tissue development.


They describe expression of this genes at different early development stages, in different cell populations, as a first step to reconstruct Gene Networks of tissue specifications (at 110 cell stage every cell is commited to one tissue).


They also use morpholino to knock down B-catenin, FoxD and Fgf8/16/20 (by separate and using all the combinations) and use RTPCR to see which genes are up or downregulated to see which genes are under direct control of these genes.
These genes are already known to be important to specify endoderm, notochord, mesenchyme alone or in some combinations.},

However, how this information is processed to control cell shape and cell dynamics is an open area of investigation. The framework that emerges from diverse disciplines such as cell biology, physics and developmental biology points to adhesion and cortical actin networks as regulators of cell surface mechanics.

What is not conserved is the initial embryonic architecture of the fertilized egg, and the specific cell behaviors used to drive mesoderm morphogenesis. How then do conserved patterning pathways adapt to diverse architectures and where do they diverge to direct the different cell behaviors used to shape the phylotypic body plan? Amphibians in particular, probably because of their broad range of reproductive strategies, show diverse embryonic architectures across their class and use diverse cell behaviors during their early morphogenesis, making them an interesting comparative group. We examine three examples from our work on amphibians that show variations in the use of cell behaviors to drive the morphogenesis of the same tissues. We also consider possible points where the conserved patterning pathways might diverge to produce different cell behaviors.},

Several signaling pathways, such as BMP, FGF, Hedgehog, Nodal, and Wnt have well-recognized instructive roles in cell fate specification during vertebrate embryogenesis. Growing evidence indicates that BMP, Nodal, and FGF signaling also regulate cell movements, and that they do so through mechanisms distinct from those that specify cell fates. Moreover, pathways controlling cell movements can also indirectly influence cell fate specification by regulating dimensions and relative positions of interacting tissues. The current challenge is to delineate the molecular mechanisms via which the major signaling pathways regulate cell fate specification and movements, and how these two processes are coordinated to ensure normal development.},

After induction of the germ layers, the blastula is transformed by gastrulation movements into a multilayered embryo with head, trunk and tail rudiments. Gastrulation is heralded by formation of a blastopore, an opening in the blastula. The axial side of the blastopore is marked by the organizer, a signaling center that patterns the germ layers and regulates gastrulation movements. During internalization, endoderm and mesoderm cells move via the blastopore beneath the ectoderm. Epiboly movements expand and thin the nascent germ layers. Convergence movements narrow the germ layers from lateral to medial while extension movements elongate them from head to tail. Despite different morphology, parallels emerge with respect to the cellular and genetic mechanisms of gastrulation in different vertebrate groups. Patterns of gastrulation cell movements relative to the blastopore and the organizer are similar from fish to mammals, and conserved molecular pathways mediate gastrulation movements.},

This rule is examined in some detail from very small organisms to large animals, and plants, and societies. Compared to other size-related rules, the size-complexity rule is relatively rough and approximate, yet clearly it holds throughout the whole range of living organisms, as well as for societies. The relationship between size and complexity is analyzed by examining the effects of size increase and decrease: size increase requires an increase in complexity, whereas size decrease permits, and sometimes requires, a decrease in complexity. Conversely, an increase or decrease in complexity permits, but does not require changes in size. An especially compelling argument for the close relation between size and complexity can be found in size quorum sensing in very small multicellular organisms.

annote = {I think that the question of this article is interesting, but im not that convinced by the conclusions.


In general what is the relation between size and complexity in the organisms (if increasing one is required for the increasing the other). Understanding size as number of cells and complexity as different types of cells.


After some examples of simple orgamisms its conclusion is that an increment of complexity is required for an increment of size, but not the opposite. 
I think that there are of course some size constraints (it cannot be more cell types than cells) or functionality constraints (for respiration simple diffusion is efficient only at a certain scale), but saving some basics constraints increasing in complexity shouldnt be required for increasing size.


it proposes some "quorum sensing" of size that is only found at intermediate (from 10s to 100s cells) sizes. I think its maybe so becaise this basic mechanisms may only work at that scale (if they are based in some gradient for example).


It claims that a decrease in size may be accompained with decrease in complexity because there are not place or some parts are necessary anymore.


I dont see much point in the example of dogs breeding that he gives, saying that in nature this increase in size should take a long time for estabilization, but in "artificial selection" you can get a lot of dog sizes even when they are "imperfect". I think that the point is that n nature there is not this directional strong selection and so the increase in size could be not adaptive, but just some random walk..


Also the example in development I found trivial. It could have say that in complex organisms there is not only a "round" of increasing in size and then in complexity, but there are a lot of intermediate steps where a subset of partially differentiated cells increase in size and the in complexity.},

Analysis of discrete morphological characters shows that initial morphological diversification in the echinoderm subphylum Blastozoa was so pronounced that morphological diversity relative to taxonomic diversity was greatest in the Cambrian, whereas morphological diversity itself was greatest in the Middle and Upper Ordovician. Thus, a small number of Cambrian taxa sparsely occupied a large range in morphological space, whereas subsequent diversification involved expansion and filling of morphospace. A measure of clade-shape asymmetry and a method for statistical testing of clade shape are used to show that morphological diversity is significantly concentrated early in the history of the Blastozoa. The subphylum represents the highest biologic level at which temporal patterns of morphological diversity have been analyzed. Because this study is based on explicit morphological analysis, not taxonomic proxies for morphological diversity, the results are not artifacts of taxonomic practice.},

abstract = {In his theory of evolution, Darwin recognized that the conditions of life play a role in the generation of hereditary variations, as well as in their selection. However, as evolutionary theory was developed further, heredity became identified with genetics, and variation was seen in terms of combinations of randomly generated gene mutations. We argue that this view is now changing, because it is clear that a notion of hereditary variation that is based solely on randomly varying genes that are unaffected by developmental conditions is an inadequate basis for evolutionary theories. Such a view not only fails to provide satisfying explanations of many evolutionary phenomena, it also makes assumptions that are not consistent with the data that are emerging from disciplines ranging from molecular biology to cultural studies. These data show that the genome is far more responsive to the environment than previously thought, and that not all transmissible variation is underlain by genetic differences. In Evolution in Four Dimensions (2005) we identify four types of inheritance (genetic, epigenetic, behavioral, and symbol-based), each of which can provide variations on which natural selection will act. Some of these variations arise in response to developmental conditions, so there are Lamarckian aspects to evolution. We argue that a better insight into evolutionary processes will result from recognizing that transmitted variations that are not based on DNA differences have played a role. This is particularly true for understanding the evolution of human behavior, where all four dimensions of heredity have been important.},

abstract = {Mammalian dentition consists of teeth that develop as discrete organs. From anterior to posterior, the dentition is divided into regions of incisor, canine, premolar and molar tooth types. Particularly teeth in the molar region are very diverse in shape. The development of individual teeth involves epithelial–mesenchymal interactions that are mediated by signals shared with other organs. Parts of the molecular details of signaling networks have been established, particularly in the signal families BMP, FGF, Hh and Wnt, mostly by the analysis of gene expression and signaling responses in knockout mice with arrested tooth development. Recent evidence suggests that largely the same signaling cascade is used reiteratively throughout tooth development. The successional determination of tooth region, tooth type, tooth crown base and individual cusps involves signals that regulate tissue growth and differentiation. Tooth type appears to be determined by epithelial signals and to involve differential activation of homeobox genes in the mesenchyme. This differential signaling could have allowed the evolutionary divergence of tooth shapes among the four tooth types. The advancing tooth morphogenesis is punctuated by transient signaling centers in the epithelium corresponding to the initiation of tooth buds, tooth crowns and individual cusps. The latter two signaling centers, the primary enamel knot and the secondary enamel knot, have been well characterized and are thought to direct the differential growth and subsequent folding of the dental epithelium. Several members of the FGF signal family have been implicated in the control of cell proliferation around the non-dividing enamel knots. Spatiotemporal induction of the secondary enamel knots determines the cusp patterns of individual teeth and is likely to involve repeated activation and inhibition of signaling as suggested for patterning of other epithelial organs.},

abstract = {The evolution of mammalian teeth is characterized by the frequent and convergent evolution of new cusps. The evolution of new cusps can be linked to tooth development via population-level variation. This allows testing whether development increases the capacity to evolve, or evolvability, by facilitating and even directing morphological change. In a population sample of living seals, variation in cusp number of individual teeth is from three to five cusps, the variably present cusps being the shortest ones that also develop last. By factoring in recent evidence on development, I show that the variation in cusp number can be explained by a patterning cascade mode of cusp development that cumulatively increases and directs height variation in short cusps. The biased variation in seal tooth cusps supports the recognition of teeth as highly evolvable because only small developmental changes are needed to produce large changes in size and number of small cusps. This evolvability of tooth cusps may have facilitated the fast and independent acquisition of new cusps in mammalian evolution. In phylogenetic studies, small cusps may be unreliable as phylogenetic signals. Population level variation can be a powerful tool in testing and generating hypotheses in developmental evolution studies.},

In this review, we will describe a series of developmental syntagms, and explore the consequences of this discontinuous organization of the developmental program on evolution.},

It gives some examples of conserved syntagms (D/V polarity, wing/limb formation) in different organisms. 


Points out that the consequences of this modular structure, syntagms can be connected in different ways and in different spatiotemporal contexts and will produce discontinous an sometime abrupt changes in evolution (opposite to gradual change).


It raises the question then if Natural Selection should be regarded as the only or primary force driving evolutionary change or this "internal constraints" play a major role by defining the "realm of possible changes".


It proposes that in a populations the connectivity of this syntagms should change randomly and some new variants can put to test.


What i dont agree with, is that it defines whether 2 element belong to the same syntagm by the effects of altering the interactions between then, it says that you should expect a mutant phenotype if the are part of the same syntagm. I dont think that is necesaryly the case because the network connectivity could be so complex that maby modifications would lead to no change but some to a major change.


Dont find why should call a syntagm a developmental cassete just because has been recruited somewhere else. 


Dont agree either with the preference with the additive model over the code model. For the hox genes the former may hold true but there are examples where differents combinations are combinatorial (like in some receptor ligand interactions, "a+b" is not the same as "a" or "b" acting alone).


But i think is a good article to convince people in genetics because the examples and the article in geeral is written in the genetics framework.},

Phylogenetic analyses of asymmetry variation, inheritance, and molecular mechanisms reveal unexpected insights into how development evolves. First, directional asymmetry, an evolutionary novelty, arose from nonheritable origins almost as often as from mutations, implying that genetic assimilation ("phenotype precedes genotype") is a common mode of evolution. Second, the molecular pathway directing hearts leftward-the nodal cascade-varies considerably among vertebrates (homology of form does not require homology of development) and was possibly co-opted from a preexisting asymmetrical chordate organ system. Finally, declining frequencies of spontaneous asymmetry reversal throughout vertebrate evolution suggest that heart development has become more canalized.},

abstract = {In vertebrate development, the body plan is determined by primordial morphogen gradients that suffuse the embryo. Retinoic acid (RA) is an important morphogen involved in patterning the anterior-posterior axis of structures, including the hindbrain and paraxial mesoderm. RA diffuses over long distances, and its activity is spatially restricted by synthesizing and degrading enzymes. However, gradients of endogenous morphogens in live embryos have not been directly observed; indeed, their existence, distribution and requirement for correct patterning remain controversial. Here we report a family of genetically encoded indicators for RA that we have termed GEPRAs (genetically encoded probes for RA). Using the principle of fluorescence resonance energy transfer we engineered the ligand-binding domains of RA receptors to incorporate cyan-emitting and yellow-emitting fluorescent proteins as fluorescence resonance energy transfer donor and acceptor, respectively, for the reliable detection of ambient free RA. We created three GEPRAs with different affinities for RA, enabling the quantitative measurement of physiological RA concentrations. Live imaging of zebrafish embryos at the gastrula and somitogenesis stages revealed a linear concentration gradient of endogenous RA in a two-tailed source-sink arrangement across the embryo. Modelling of the observed linear RA gradient suggests that the rate of RA diffusion exceeds the spatiotemporal dynamics of embryogenesis, resulting in stability to perturbation. Furthermore, we used GEPRAs in combination with genetic and pharmacological perturbations to resolve competing hypotheses on the structure of the RA gradient during hindbrain formation and somitogenesis. Live imaging of endogenous concentration gradients across embryonic development will allow the precise assignment of molecular mechanisms to developmental dynamics and will accelerate the application of approaches based on morphogen gradients to tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.},

The hourglass model suggests evolutionary change is most difficult at an intermediate "phylotypic" stage, the adaptive penetrance model suggests change is easiest at an intermediate stage, and the early conservation model suggests change is easier later in ontogeny. Although versions of some of these models have been discussed since the nineteenth century, quantitative approaches have been proposed only recently. Here we present quantitative phylogenetic approaches to evaluating trends in the evolution of ontogeny. We apply these approaches to the proposed models and demonstrate that an existing approach to assessing these models is biased. We show that the hourglass, adaptive penetrance, and early conservation models are unnecessarily complex explanations of the patterns observed in developmental event data for 14 species of vertebrates. Rather, a simpler model that postulates that evolutionary change is easier between ontogenetically adjacent events is adequate.},

abstract = {Cultural evolution is a complex process that can happen at several levels. At the level of individuals in a population, each human bears a set of cultural traits that he or she can transmit to its offspring (vertical transmission) or to other members of his or her society (horizontal transmission). The relative frequency of a cultural trait in a population or society can thus increase or decrease with the relative reproductive success of its bearers (individual's level) or the relative success of transmission (called the idea's level). This article presents a mathematical model on the interplay between these two levels. The first aim of this article is to explore when cultural evolution is driven by the idea's level, when it is driven by the individual's level and when it is driven by both. These three possibilities are explored in relation to (a) the amount of interchange of cultural traits between individuals, (b) the selective pressure acting on individuals, (c) the rate of production of new cultural traits, (d) the individual's capacity to remember cultural traits and to the population size. The aim is to explore the conditions in which cultural evolution does not lead to a better adaptation of individuals to the environment. This is to contrast the spread of fitness-enhancing ideas, which make individual bearers better adapted to the environment, to the spread of "selfish" ideas, which spread well simply because they are easy to remember but do not help their individual bearers (and may even hurt them). At the same time this article explores in which conditions the adaptation of individuals is maximal. The second aim is to explore how these factors affect cultural diversity, or the amount of different cultural traits in a population. This study suggests that a larger interchange of cultural traits between populations could lead to cultural evolution not improving the adaptation of individuals to their environment and to a decrease of cultural diversity.},

The model is a set of individuals with N cultural traits (ideas). Each trait has two different fitness values, one for the individual thas bears it and a second for the trait itself, so can be that one idea can have a high fitness value (just because is easy to remember and pass it) even when is not beneficial for the individual.

        
The conclusion of the article is that when increasing the communication between individuals and if the selection is not high (at individual level) the cultural diversity will decrease and the fitness at level of individual will decrease.

Here, we argue that noise in signaling networks results from the intrinsic promiscuity of protein-protein interactions (PPIs), and that this noise has shaped cellular signal transduction. Features promoted by the presence of this molecular signaling noise include multimerization and clustering of signaling components, pleiotropic effects of gross changes in protein concentration, and a probabilistic rather than a linear view of signal propagation.},

abstract = {Convergent evolution is a phenomenon whereby similar traits evolved independently in not closely related species, and is often interpreted in functional terms. Spines in mollusk seashells are classically interpreted as having repeatedly evolved as a defense in response to shell-crushing predators. Here we consider the morphogenetic process that shapes these structures and underlies their repeated emergence. We develop a mathematical model for spine morphogenesis based on the mechanical interaction between the secreting mantle edge and the calcified shell edge to which the mantle adheres during shell growth. It is demonstrated that a large diversity of spine structures can be accounted for through small variations in control parameters of this natural mechanical process. This physical mechanism suggests that convergent evolution of spines can be understood through a generic morphogenetic process, and provides unique perspectives in understanding the phenotypic evolution of this second largest phylum in the animal kingdom.},
annote = {They make a simple model of seashell shell development. They use a discrete model with an initial mantle edge configuration, which at each iteration secretes (at constant growth rate) an excess of new mantle, that adheres to the previous configuration (shell)via elastic periostracum, and deforms depending on the growth rate and elastic properties of the mantle.
They argue that the convergent evolution of spiny seashells are easy to understand through this mechanistic morphogenetic model.
its funny that they dont mention the tooth model when they say that 3D modelling its in its "infancy".},

abstract = {We have carried out a large-scale, semi-automated whole-mount in situ hybridization screen of 8369 cDNA clones in Xenopus laevis embryos. We confirm that differential gene expression is prevalent during embryogenesis since 24{\%} of the clones are expressed non-ubiquitously and 8{\%} are organ or cell type specific marker genes. Sequence analysis and clustering yielded 723 unique genes displaying a differential expression pattern. Of these, 18{\%} were already described in Xenopus, 47{\%} have homologs and 35{\%} are lacking significant sequence similarity in databases. Many of them encode known developmental regulators. We classified 363 of the 723 genes for which a Gene Ontology annotation for molecular function could be attributed and found 'DNA binding' and 'enzyme' the most represented terms. The most common protein domains encoded in these embryonic, differentially expressed genes are the homeobox and RNA Recognition Motif (RRM). Fifty-nine putative orthologs of human disease genes, and 254 organ or cell specific marker genes were identified. Markers were found for nasal placode and archenteron roof, organs for which a specific marker was previously unavailable. Markers were also found for novel subdomains of various other organs. The tissues for which most markers were found are muscle and epidermis. Expression of cell cycle regulators fell in two classes, containing proliferation-promoting and anti-proliferative genes, respectively. We identified 66 new members of the BMP4, chromatin, endoplasmic reticulum, and karyopherin synexpression groups, thus providing a first glimpse of their probable cellular roles. Cluster analysis of tissues to measure tissue relatedness yielded some unorthodox affinities besides expectable lineage relationships. In conclusion, this study represents an atlas of gene expression patterns, which reveals embryonic regionalization, provides novel marker genes, and makes predictions about the functional role of unknown genes.},

abstract = {Teeth are a good system for studying development and evolution. Tooth development is largely independent of the rest of the body and teeth can be grown in culture to attain almost normal morphology. Their development is not affected by the patterns of movement or sensorial perception in the embryo. Teeth are hard and easily preserved. Thus, there is plenty of easily accessible information about the patterns of morphological variation occurring between and within species. This review summarises recent work and describes how tooth development can be understood as the coupling between a reaction-diffusion system and differential growth produced by diffusible growth factors: which growth factors are involved, how they affect each other's expression and how they affect the spatial patterns of proliferation that lead to final morphology. There are some aspects of tooth development, however, that do not conform to some common assumptions in many reaction-diffusion models. Those are discussed here since they provide clues about how reaction-diffusion systems may work in actual developmental systems. Mathematical models implementing what we know about tooth development are discussed.},

Combining these data with molecular sequences, we obtained a phylogenetic tree that, when calibrated with fossils, shows that crown clade Placentalia and placental orders originated after the K-Pg boundary. Many nodes discovered using molecular data are upheld, but phenomic signals overturn molecular signals to show Sundatheria (Dermoptera + Scandentia) as the sister taxon of Primates, a close link between Proboscidea (elephants) and Sirenia (sea cows), and the monophyly of echolocating Chiroptera (bats).

On the basis of in vivo analysis of mitotic cell junction dynamics in Drosophila imaginal discs, we mathematically predict the convergence of epithelial topology to a fixed equilibrium distribution of cellular polygons. This distribution is empirically confirmed in tissue samples from vertebrate, arthropod and cnidarian organisms, suggesting that a similar proliferation-dependent cell pattern underlies pattern formation and morphogenesis throughout the metazoa.},

This claim turns out to be quite complicated, both in terms of whether development was genuinely excluded and how to understand the different kinds of embryological research that might have contributed. The present paper reevaluates this central claim by focusing on the practice of model organism choice. Through a survey of examples utilized in the literature of the Modern synthesis, I identify a previously overlooked feature: exclusion of research on marine invertebrates. Understanding the import of this pattern requires interpreting it in terms of two epistemic values operating in biological research: theoretical generality and explanatory completeness. In tandem, these values clarify and enhance the significance of this exclusion. The absence of marine invertebrates implied both a lack of generality in the resulting theory and a lack of completeness with respect to particular evolutionary problems, such as evolvability and the origin of novelty. These problems were salient to embryological researchers aware of the variation and diversity of larval forms in marine invertebrates. In closing, I apply this analysis to model organism choice in evo-devo and discuss its relevance for an extended evolutionary synthesis.},

Here we address the fundamental advances in understanding ciliated epithelia that have been achieved using Xenopus as a model system. Xenopus embryos are covered with a ciliated epithelium that propels fluid unidirectionally across their surface. The external nature of this tissue, coupled with the molecular tools available in Xenopus and the ease of microscopic analysis on intact animals has thrust Xenopus to the forefront of ciliated epithelia biology. We discuss advances in understanding the molecular regulators of ciliated epithelia cell fate as well as basic aspects of ciliated epithelia cell biology including ciliogenesis and cell polarity.},
annote = {They make a summary on what is know about ciliated epithelia in Xenopus.


MULTICILIATED CELL
To have multiciliatede cells it is necessary to have a centriole duplication decoupled of the cell cycle. then the basal bodies of the centriole migrate apically by fusing to vesicles and then extend their ciliary axoneme.
The fusing into the apical membrane is prevented in Dishelved morpholino-mutants, and other PCP pathway proteins. This suggest a co-option of the basal bodies to the PCP apically located machinery.


CILIOGENESIS
Multiciliated epithelia is present in xenopus early on its development. The precursors generates in a epidermal sub-layer in stage 17 and undergo radial intercalation to join outer epidermis on stage 25.
The Notch pathway is involved in the regulation of the ciliated-cell fate but not in the intercalation process.


CILIA POLARIZATION
The ciliated cells use the PCP cues to polarizate themselves in respect to the tissue and to ploarize their cilia in respect to the cell. The PCP pathway (i.e. Vangl2, Fz-3, Dsv) has been implicated by mutant phenotype and tissue transplant. 
Apparently the PCP cue is only partly responsible for the polarization, a Flow Feedback Loop is required to obtain a refined polarity (after PCP signalling, there is only a "bias" on the polarization and then the flow produced by the beating of the cilia refine this).},

abstract = {The causes and mechanisms of evolutionary diversification are central issues in biology. Geographic isolation is the traditional explanation for diversification, but recent theoretical and empirical studies have shown that frequency-dependent selection can drive diversification without isolation and that adaptive diversification occurring in sympatry may be an important source of biological diversity. However, there are no empirical examples in which sympatric lineage splits have been understood at the genetic level, and it is unknown how predictable this process is-that is, whether similar ecological settings lead to parallel evolutionary dynamics of diversification. We documented the genetic basis and the evolutionary dynamics of adaptive diversification in three replicate evolution experiments, in which competition for two carbon sources caused initially isogenic populations of the bacterium Escherichia coli to diversify into two coexisting ecotypes representing different physiological adaptations in the central carbohydrate metabolism. Whole-genome sequencing of clones of each ecotype from different populations revealed many parallel and some unique genetic changes underlying the derived phenotypes, including changes to the same genes and sometimes to the same nucleotide. Timelines of allele frequencies extracted from the frozen "fossil" record of the three evolving populations suggest parallel evolutionary dynamics driven at least in part by a co-evolutionary process in which mutations causing one type of physiology changed the ecological environment, allowing the invasion of mutations causing an alternate physiology. This process closely corresponds to the evolutionary dynamics seen in mathematical models of adaptive diversification due to frequency-dependent ecological interactions. The parallel genetic changes underlying similar phenotypes in independently evolved lineages provide empirical evidence of adaptive diversification as a predictable evolutionary process.},

A few of these genes have been examined in both X. tropicalis and X. laevis and the cross-species comparison has been proven invaluable for studying gene function. A recently published work has yielded developmental expression profiles for the majority of Xenopus genes across fourteen developmental stages spanning the blastula, gastrula, neurula, and the tail-bud. While this data was originally queried for global evolutionary and developmental principles, here we demonstrate its general use for gene-level analyses. In particular, we present the accessibility of this dataset through Xenbase and describe biases in the characterized genes in terms of sequence and expression conservation across the two species. We further indicate the advantage of examining coexpression for gene function discovery relating to developmental processes conserved across species. We suggest that the integration of additional large-scale datasets--comprising diverse functional data--into Xenbase promises to provide a strong foundation for researchers in elucidating biological processes including the gene regulatory programs encoding development.},

abstract = {Organ shape depends on the coordination between cell proliferation and the spatial arrangement of cells during development. Much is known about the mechanisms that regulate cell proliferation, but the processes by which the cells are orderly distributed remain unknown. This can be accomplished either by random division of cells that later migrate locally to new positions (cell allocation) or through polarized cell division (oriented cell division; OCD). Recent data suggest that the OCD is involved in some morphogenetic processes such as vertebrate gastrulation, neural tube closure, and growth of shoot apex in plants; however, little is known about the contribution of OCD during organogenesis. We have analyzed the orientation patterns of cell division throughout the development of wild-type and mutant imaginal discs of Drosophila. Our results show a causal relationship between the orientation of cell divisions in the imaginal disc and the adult morphology of the corresponding organs, indicating a key role of OCD in organ-shape definition. In addition, we find that a subset of planar cell polarity genes is required for the proper orientation of cell division during organ development.},

This topic is studied here with a focus on the evolution of a pollen ontogenetic feature, the last points of callose deposition (LPCD) pattern, involved in the determination of an adaptive morphological pollen character (aperture pattern). The LPCD pattern exhibits a low level of evolution in eudicots, as compared to the evolution observed in monocots. Stasis in this pattern might be explained by developmental constraints expressed during male meiosis (microsporogenesis) or by selective pressures expressed through the adaptive role of the aperture pattern. Here, we demonstrate that the LPCD pattern is conserved in Euphorbiaceae s.s. and that this conservatism is primarily due to selective pressures. A phylogenetic association was found between the putative removal of selective pressures on pollen morphology after the origin of inaperturate pollen, and the appearance of variation in microsporogenesis and in the resulting LPCD pattern, suggesting that stasis was due to these selective pressures. However, even in a neutral context, variation in microsporogenesis was biased. This should therefore favour the appearance of some developmental and morphological phenotypes rather than others.},

Their origin and maintenance should represent a key element of a comprehensive theory of morphological evolution. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the causation of homology and to investigate the mechanisms underlying its origination. The study of this issue cannot be limited to the molecular level, because there appears to exist no strict correspondence between genetic and morphological evolution. It is argued that the establishment of homology follows three distinct (if overlapping) steps: (a) the generation of morphological building elements; (b) the integration of new elements into a body plan; and (c) the autonomization of integrated construction units as lineage-specific homologues of phenotypic evolution. In contrast with traditional views, it is proposed that the mechanistic basis for steps (a) and (b) is largely epigenetic, i.e. a consequence of the inherent propensities of developmental system under changing conditions. Step (c) transcends the proximate mechanisms underlying the establishment of homologues and makes them independent attractors of morphological organization at the phenotypic level.},

abstract = {The quest for a rational taxonomy of living forms began in the 17th century. Since the general acceptance of Darwin's theory of descent with modification, however, students of morphology became preoccupied with a systematics based on the genealogy of groups; and the rise of molecular phylogenies in recent years results in a further decline in the science of morphology. Reconstructing phylogenies by itself brings us no closer to the goal of rational taxonomy, which is to uncover the natural order inherent in the forms of living things. It is proposed that the rational taxonomy of forms should be derived from a study of development, much as von Baer had envisaged. To illustrate the method, a set of segmentation abnormalities in Drosophila larvae (previously exposed to either vapour) is considered, which can be individually classified as distinct disturbances in the process responsible for establishing normal segmental pattern. The process consists of a hierarchy of four successive bifurcations dividing the embryo's body first into two parts, then four, eight, and finally 16 subdivisions or segments. This gives rise to a taxonomic map of all possible transformations which contains the “phylogeny” of the actual forms and provides a natural system for classifying them. Attempts to recover the “true” phylogeny by various numerical methods are summarized and their implications for the validity of the basic assumptions of contemporary systematics discussed.},
annote = {It makes for one side a critic on the nowadays systematics, which is only concerned with the genealogy of groups, and with the help of molecular systematics, only with the reconstruction of phylogenies, far away from what she consideres the original 

rational taxonomy 


, which tried to explain the natural order of the living forms. 

And in the other side she wants to test if the cladistic approach can recover the "natural system" inherent on the formation of forms.




SHe proposes that the only way to achieve the original goal is by studying the development (coupled with mathematical modelling) to produce a "phenotypic map" or transformation map of posible forms.


To illustrate it, she makes a transition map of the posible forms during the segmentation in the embryogenesis of drosophila. As the segmentation occurs by 4 sequential bifurcations that double the number of segments (2,4,6,16) and the latter bifurcations depend on the early, not all the combinations are posible. Then she coded all the morphologies on the presence or absence of the 15 characters (cladistic) and a parsimony cladogram was reconstructed.


By comparing the "real ontogenetic cladogram" (with the hierarchic transitions during which the morphologies were generated), with the parsimony cladogram, major differences between them persist (Ontogeny vs cladistic).


As some morphologies are caused by single-gene mutation, a" genealogical cladogram" can be constructed, when all the mutants are one-step away from the wild-type. then, by considering only the genetic relatedness, the developmentall hierarchy collapse (Ontogeny vs Systematics).


she ends saying that " if we are going to take biological form seriously , we have to investigate the developmetal process for reconstructing the rational taxonomy of forms, which is independent of the reconstruction of the phylogenetic history of genes"},

The origins of Wolpert's concept of positional information of around 1970 are analysed; this markedly different model of embryogenesis effectively took the place of the organizer, following on from a generally assumed out-datedness of the corpus of Spemann's data and concepts. Explanations in terms of historical forces are suggested; events are seen as a historical causal chain. A crucial factor appears to have been the long-term neglect of morphogenetic cell movement as an integral component of an adequate induction-based model. The paper discusses the general inter-relation of history and science, and particularly the implications for current scientific practice, including the potential for conceptual distortions due to historical factors.

abstract = {Evolutionary developmental biology (Evo-Devo) as a discipline is concerned, among other things, with discovering and understanding the role of changes in developmental mechanisms in the evolutionary origin of aspects of the phenotype. In a very real sense, Evo-Devo opens the black box between genotype and phenotype, or more properly, phenotypes as multiple life history stages arise in many organisms from a single genotype. Changes in the timing or positioning of an aspect of development in a descendant relative to an ancestor (heterochrony and heterotopy) were two evolutionary developmental mechanisms identified by Ernst Haeckel in the 1870s. Many more have since been identified, in large part because of our enhanced understanding of development and because new mechanisms emerge as development proceeds: the transfer from maternal to zygotic genomic control; cell-to-cell interactions; cell differentiation and cell migration; embryonic inductions; functional interactions at the tissue and organ levels; growth. Within these emergent processes, gene networks and gene cascades (genetic modules) link the genotype with morphogenetic units (cellular modules, namely germ layers, embryonic fields or cellular condensations), while epigenetic processes such as embryonic inductions, tissue interactions and functional integration, link morphogenetic units to the phenotype. Evolutionary developmental mechanisms also include interactions between individuals of the same species, individuals of different species, and species and their biotic and/or abiotic environment. Such interactions link ecological communities. Importantly, there is little to distinguish the causality that underlies these interactions from that which underlies inductive interactions within embryos.},

The role of natural selection is itself limited: it cannot adequately explain the diversity of populations or of species; nor can it account for the origin of new species or for major evolutionary change. The evidence suggests on the one hand that most genetic changes are irrelevant to evolution; and on the other, that a relative lack of natural selection may be the prerequisite for major evolutionary advance. Contrary to the neo-Darwinian view, we point out that the variations of the phenotype, on which natural selection could act, do not arise at random; they are produced by interactions between the organism and the environment during development. We propose, therefore, that the intrinsic dynamical structure of the epigenetic system itself, in its interaction with the environment, is the source of non-random variations which direct evolutionary change, and that a proper study of evolution consists in the working out of the dynamics of the epigenetic system and its response to environmental stimuli as well as the mechanisms whereby novel developmental responses are canalized. We postulate that “large” evolutionary changes could be the result of the canalization of novel developmental responses which arose from environmental challenges under conditions of relaxed natural selection, and moreover, that the canalization of novel developmental responses might involve cytoplasmic inheritance or maternal effects at least in the initial stages.},

This notion of accessibility can be used to define a relation of nearness among phenotypes, independently of their similarity. Because of neutrality, phenotypes denote equivalence classes of genotypes. The definition of neighborhood relations among phenotypes relies, therefore, on the statistics of neighborhood relations among equivalence classes of genotypes in genotype space. The folding of RNA sequence (genotypes) into secondary structures (phenotypes) is an ideal case to implement these concepts. We study the extent to which the folding of RNA sequence induces a "statistical topology" on the set of minimum free energy secondary structures. The resulting nearness relation suggests a notion of "continuous" structure transformation. We can, then rationalize major transitions in evolutionary trajectories at the level of RNA structures by identifying those transformations which are irreducibly discontinuous. This is shown by means of computer simulations. The statistical topology organizing the set of RNA shapes explains why neutral drift in sequence space plays a key role in evolutionary optimization.},

This new synthesis emphasizes three morphological areas of biology that had been marginalized by the Modern Synthesis of genetics and evolution: embryology, macroevolution, and homology. The foundations for this new synthesis have been provided by new findings from developmental genetics and from the reinterpretation of the fossil record. In this nascent synthesis, macroevolutionary questions are not seen as being soluble by population genetics, and the developmental actions of genes involved with growth and cell specification are seen as being critical for the formation of higher taxa. In addition to discovering the remarkable homologies of homeobox genes and their domains of expression, developmental genetics has recently proposed homologies of process that supplement the older homologies of structure. Homologous developmental pathways, such those involving the wnt genes, are seen in numerous embryonic processes, and they are seen occurring in discrete regions, the morphogenetic fields. These fields (which exemplify the modular nature of developing embryos) are proposed to mediate between genotype and phenotype. Just as the cell (and not its genome) functions as the unit of organic structure and function, so the morphogenetic field (and not the genes or the cells) is seen as a major unit of ontogeny whose changes bring about changes in evolution.},

We review empirical data for one well studied group of vertebrates, salamanders of the family Plethodontidae. Despite much evolution at the level of allozymes, proteins such as albumin, and DNA, morphological evolution has been slow, and has been concentrated in relatively short spans of time. The dominant theme has been morphological stasis. An important contributing factor appears to be plasticity—behavioral, physiological, and developmental—which allows organisms to compensate environmental, and even genetic, perturbations without having to change morphologically. Organisms are self-produced and self-maintained systems, and we argue that the best measure of evolutionary adaptation is the persistence of this autopoietic system. Internal dynamics of the organism determine what change will occur and how it is to be expressed. Stable systems can be established which transcend species borders, and the fossil record offers no evidence with regard to speciation rates, or the relationship of speciation events to morphological evolution.

abstract = {A fundamental riddle of evolutionary developmental biology is the conservation of adult morphological patterns (Hall, 1992). Conservative patterns are either called body plans if they concern overall body design, or homologues if they concern parts of the body (Riedl, 1978; Roth, 1982; Sattler, 1984; Van Valen, 1982; Wagner, 1989a, 1989b). An adult pattern is considered conservative if it remains unchanged in spite of changes in function, as indicated by the original definition of homology by Owen, as a similarity of organs regardless of form and function (Owen, 1848). Conservation of anatomical features despite different adaptive pressures is naturally explained by developmental constraints (Wagner, 1986). However, this approach to explain the biological basis of homology is plagued by the fact that developmental pathways are often more variable than the characters that they produce (see Tab. 1) (Hall, 1992; Roth, 1988, 1991; Spemann, 1915; Wagner, 1989b). This is also true for any other application of the concept of developmental constraints. The widely held opinion that early stages of development are conservative because any early perturbation is likely to interfere with later development, is far from absolute, since a vast amount of data in comparative developmental biology speaks to developmental variation (see e.g. the examples in Tab. 1). The question then is, how can developmental constraints on adult variation be reconciled with the fact of developmental variation?},
annote = {The article wants to aboard the problematic of the concept of developmental constraint because of the growing evidence at the time that, even when the adult phenotype is conserved, the development mechanisms that produces are not.



It says that the process of morphogenesis can be different from the process of (adult or late development) maintanance. and that if the latter process has some tisue interactions that maintain the final morphology, then the morphogenetic processes can vary.



the problem with this is that to "reconcile" developmental constraints with developmental variation, they only propose that there is different constraints (in differents times in development), so that if there is early embryonic variation, a later constraint will act to stabilize (at the end talks about canalization) or "limit" the phenotypic variation.
So ultimately it doesnt attack the problem of "constraint".},

abstract = {Organicism (materialistic holism) has provided the philosophical underpinnings for embryology since the time of Kant. It had influenced the founders of developmental mechanics, and the importance of organicism to embryology was explicitly recognized by such figures as O. Hertwig, H. Spemann, R. Harrison, A. M. Dalq, J. Needham, and C. H. Waddington. Many of the principles of organicism remain in contemporary developmental biology, but they are rarely defined as such. A combination of genetic reductionism and the adoption of holism by unscientific communities has led to the devaluation of organicism as a fruitful heuristic for research. This essay attempts to define organicism, provide a brief history of its importance to experimental embryology, outline some sociologically based reasons for its decline, and document its value in contemporary developmental biology. Based on principles or organicism, developmental biology should become a science of emerging complexity. However, this does mean that some of us will have to learn calculus.},
annote = {It talks about organicism and why it is so important for biological sciences.



First defines organicism (complex wholes are more than the sum of its parts) and compares it whit reductionism (wholes can be expleained completely from the properties of its parts).


One crucial concept in organicism is emergent properties. Emergent properties are properties that only arise with the interaction among parts of a whole and cannot be subscribed to any part.

Gives examples of great embryologists that were organicists (waddington, spemman, von baer)..


Argues that the underpinning of organicism in the last century it has been because it has been asociated with other ideologies (vitalism, socialism, nazism).


It ends with a critic of a gene centered view of biology, been this a reductionism. So genes cannot explain by themselves phenotype, evolution or behavior. Gene function depends on the cellular context, as the cellular depends on the tissue context an so on.



It remarks the importance of a computational approach to finally embrace complexity.},

abstract = {SYNOPSIS. The role of development in constraining the directionality and patterns of morphological evolution is examined. The nature of morphological variation and appearance of morphological novelties is determined by the epigenetic properties of the organism. Consideration of these properties has profound implications for current theories of morphological evolution. Developmental constraints impose severe limitations on the gradualistic action of directional selection. Evolutionis viewed as the result of differential survival of morphological novelties. However, the production of morphological novelties by developmental programs is not random. This non-randomness in morphologically expressed genetic mutations--an epigenetic property--can result in phyletic trends, parallelisms and convergences.},

Recently, the investigation of gene expression data and the analysis of patterning gene function have revived interest in insect head development. Here, we argue that the red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum is a well suited model organism to spearhead research with respect to the genetic control of insect head development. We review recent molecular data and discuss its bearing on early development and morphogenesis of the head. We present a novel hypothesis on the ontogenetic origin of insect head sutures and review recent insights into the question on the origin of the labrum. Further, we argue that the study of developmental genes may identify the elusive anterior non-segmental region and present some evidence in favor of its existence. With respect to the question of evolution of patterning we show that the head Anlagen of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and Tribolium differ considerably and we review profound differences of their genetic regulation. Finally, we discuss which insect model species might help us to answer the open questions concerning the genetic regulation of head development and its evolution.},

We demonstrate that this polarizing activity codes by RAS-regulated ERK1/2 signaling and depends on the topographical location of the secondary organizers: the isthmic organizer (IsO) and the anterior neural ridge (anr) but not on zona limitans intrathalamica (zli). Our results suggest that Sprouty2, a negative modulator of RAS/ERK pathway, is important for regulating Fgf8 morphogenetic signal activity by controlling Fgf8-induced signaling pathways and positional information during early brain development.},

Although stem cell cycling within single hair follicles has been studied, less is known about regenerative behavior in a hair follicle population. By combining predictive mathematical modeling with in vivo studies in mice and rabbits, we show that a follicle progresses through cycling stages by continuous integration of inputs from intrinsic follicular and extrinsic environmental signals based on universal patterning principles. Signaling from the WNT/bone morphogenetic protein activator/inhibitor pair is coopted to mediate interactions among follicles in the population. This regenerative strategy is robust and versatile because relative activator/inhibitor strengths can be modulated easily, adapting the organism to different physiological and evolutionary needs.},

abstract = {Wnt signalling is one of the fundamental cell communication systems operating in the embryo and the collection of 19 Wnt and 10 Frizzled (Fzd) receptor genes (in mouse and human) represent just part of a complex system to be unravelled. Here we present a spatially comprehensive set of data on the 3D distribution of Wnt and Fzd gene expression patterns at a carefully selected single stage of mouse development. Overviews and selected features of the patterns are presented and the full 3D data set, generated by fully described probes, is available to the research community through the Edinburgh Mouse Atlas of Gene Expression. In addition to being comprehensive, the data set has been generated and recorded in a consistent manner to facilitate comparisons between gene expression patterns with the capacity to generate matching virtual sections from the 3D representations for specific studies. Expression patterns in the left forelimb were selected for more detailed comparative description. In addition to confirming the previously published expression of these genes, our whole embryo and limb bud analyses significantly extend the data in terms of details of the patterns and the addition of previously undetected sites of expression. Our focussed analysis of expression domains in the limb, defined by just two gene families, reveals a surprisingly high degree of spatial complexity and underlines the enormous potential for local cellular interactions that exist within an emerging structure. This work also highlights the use of OPT to generate detailed high-quality, spatially complex expression data that is readily comparable between specimens and can be reviewed and reanalysed as required for specific studies. It represents a core set of data that will be extended with additional stages of development and through addition of potentially interacting genes and ultimately other cross-regulatory communication pathways operating in the embryo.},

abstract = {A Drosophila FGF receptor homolog (DFGF-R2/DFRI) termed Heartless (Htl) is expressed in the embryonic mesoderm. The phenotypes of null mutant embryos demonstrated that Htl is a central player that is required for the development of several mesodermal lineages. No abnormalities in the primary specification of the mesoderm were observed. The first defects were seen as irregular migration and spreading of the mesoderm over the ectoderm. Subsequently, cell fates were not induced in several lineages including the visceral mesoderm, heart, and the dorsal somatic muscles. The defects in the induction of cell fates are likely to result from failure of the mesoderm to spread over the ectoderm and receive patterning signals. The defective spreading could be circumvented in htl mutant embryos by providing an ectopic Dpp patterning signal, leading to the formation of heart and dorsal muscle cells. Htl appears to be required also subsequently during the migration and morphogenesis of the different lineages. Expression of a dominant-negative htl construct after the initial induction of cell fates gave rise to aberrant migration and organization of the visceral mesoderm, heart, and somatic muscles. Thus, a common role for Htl in cell migration and tissue organization may account for the pleiotropic defects of the htl mutation.},

I argue that evolutionary biology has never seen a paradigm shift, in the philosophical sense of the term, except when it moved from natural theology to empirical science in the middle of the 19th century.

Yet, other forms of internal constraint, which have received less attention, may also exist. It will be argued here that a set of partial constraints below the level of phenotypes, those involving genes and molecules, influences and channels the set of possible evolutionary trajectories. At the top-most organizational level there are the genetic network modules, whose operations directly underlie complex morphological traits. The properties of these network modules, however, have themselves been set by the evolutionary history of the component genes and their interactions. Characterization of the components, structures, and operational dynamics of specific genetic networks should lead to a better understanding not only of the morphological traits they underlie but of the biases that influence the directions of evolutionary change. Furthermore, such knowledge may permit assessment of the relative degrees of probability of short evolutionary trajectories, those on the microevolutionary scale. In effect, a network perspective may help transform evolutionary biology into a scientific enterprise with greater predictive capability than it has hitherto possessed.},

abstract = {Genes encoding Wnt ligands are crucial in body patterning and are highly conserved among metazoans. Given their conservation at the protein-coding level, it is likely that changes in where and when these genes are active are important in generating evolutionary variations. However, we lack detailed knowledge about how their deployment has diverged. Here, we focus on four Wnt subfamilies (Wnt2, Wnt5, Wnt7, and Wnt8) in mammalian and avian species, consisting of a paralogous gene pair in each, believed to have duplicated in the last common ancestor of vertebrates. We use three-dimensional imaging to capture expression patterns in detail and carry out systematic comparisons. We find evidence of greater divergence between these subgroup paralogues than the respective orthologues, consistent with some level of subfunctionalization/neofunctionalization in the common vertebrate ancestor that has been conserved. However, there were exceptions; in the case of chick Wnt2b, individual sites were shared with both mouse Wnt2 and Wnt2b. We also find greater divergence, between paralogues and orthologues, in some subfamilies (Wnt2 and Wnt8) compared to others (Wnt5 and Wnt7) with the more highly similar expression patterns showing more extensive expression in more structures in the embryo. Wnt8 genes were most restricted and most divergent. Major sites of expression for all subfamilies include CNS, limbs, and facial region, and in general there were more similarities in gene deployment in these territories with divergent patterns featuring more in organs such as heart and gut. A detailed comparison of gene expression patterns in the limb showed similarities in overall combined domains across species with notable differences that may relate to lineage-specific morphogenesis.},

Here, we argue that this inevitably leads to an increase in the interdependency between functions that, in turn, influences the degree to which novel variations can be tolerated. In this 'transitionist' scheme, evolution is neither inherently gradualist nor punctuated but, instead, progresses from one extreme to the other, together with the increased complexity of organisms.},

abstract = {The vertebrate limb has provided evolutionary and developmental biologists with grist for theory and experiment for at least a century. Its most salient features are its pattern of discrete skeletal elements, the general proximodistal increase in element number as development proceeds, and the individualization of size and shape of the elements in line with functional requirements. Despite increased knowledge of molecular changes during limb development, however, the mechanisms for origination and innovation of the vertebrate limb pattern are still uncertain. We suggest that the bauplan of the limb is based on an interplay of genetic and epigenetic processes; in particular, the self-organizing properties of precartilage mesenchymal tissue are proposed to provide the basis for its ability to generate regularly spaced nodules and rods of cartilage. We provide an experimentally based "core" set of cellular and molecular processes in limb mesenchyme that, under realistic conditions, exhibit the requisite self-organizing behavior for pattern origination. We describe simulations that show that under limb bud-like geometries the core mechanism gives rise to skeletons with authentic proximodistal spatiotemporal organization. Finally, we propose that evolution refines skeletal templates generated by this process by mobilizing accessory molecular and biomechanical regulatory processes to shape the developing limb and its individual elements. Morphological innovation may take place when such modulatory processes exceed a threshold defined by the dynamics of the skeletogenic system and elements are added or lost.},

In mammals, tubulogenesis underscores the development of several systems and organs, including the vascular system, the lungs, and the kidneys. All tubular systems are hierarchical, branching into segments of gradually diminishing diameter. There are only 2 cell types that form the lumen of tubular systems: either endothelial cells in the vascular system or epithelial cells in all other organs. The most important feature in determining the morphology of the tubular systems is the frequency and geometry of branching. Hence, deciphering the molecular mechanisms underlying the sprouting of new branches from preexisting ones is the key to understanding the formation of tubular systems. The morphological similarity between the various tubular systems is underscored by similarities between the signaling pathways which control their branching. A prominent feature common to these pathways is their duality--an agonist counterbalanced by an inhibitor. The formation of the tracheal system in Drosophila melanogaster is driven by fibroblast growth factor and inhibited by Sprouty/Notch. In vertebrates, the analogous pathways are fibroblast growth factor and transforming growth factor-beta in epithelial tubular systems or vascular endothelial growth factor and Notch in the vascular system.},

Here, we describe the Drosophila gene branchless (bnl) and demonstrate that it is a key determinant of the tracheal branching pattern. bnl is required for tracheal branching and is expressed dynamically in clusters of cells surrounding the developing tracheal system at each position where a new branch will form and grow out. Localized misexpression of bnl can direct branch formation and outgrowth to new positions. Generalized misexpression activates later programs of tracheal gene expression and branching, resulting in massive networks of branches. bnl encodes a homolog of mammalian fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) and appears to function as a ligand for the breathless receptor tyrosine kinase, an FGF receptor homolog expressed on developing tracheal cells. The results suggest that this FGF pathway specifies the tracheal branching pattern by guiding tracheal cell migration during primary branch formation and then activating later programs of finer branching at the ends of growing primary branches.},

Extracellular events that lead to receptor activation are one mechanism by which signaling is modulated.

Consequently, vn may promote tissue-specific receptor activation. Unlike two other ligands, Gurken (Grk) and Spitz (Spi), which are transforming growth factor alpha-like proteins, Vn has both an immunoglobulin-like and an EGF-like domain.

Closely related proteins have been identified in other animals, and a human homolog is implicated in the genetic disease Cat-Eye Syndrome. The two most abundantly expressed ADGFs in Drosophila larvae are ADGF-A, which is strongly expressed in the gut and lymph glands, and ADGF-D, which is mainly expressed in the fat body and brain. Recombinant ADGF-A and ADGF-D are active adenosine deaminases (ADAs), and they cause polarization and serum-independent proliferation of imaginal disk and embryonic cells in vitro. The enzymatic activity of these proteins is required for their mitogenic function, making them unique among growth factors. A culture medium prepared without adenosine, or depleted of adenosine by using bovine ADA, also stimulates proliferation of imaginal disk cells, and addition of adenosine to this medium inhibits proliferation.

abstract = {Anterior head segmentation is governed by different regulatory mechanisms than those that control trunk segmentation in Drosophila. For segment polarity genes, both initial mode of activation as well as cross-regulatory interactions among them differ from the typical genetic circuitry in the trunk and are unique for each of the procephalic segments. In order to better understand the segment-specific gene network responsible for the procephalic expression of the earliest active segment polarity genes wingless and hedgehog, we started to identify and analyze cis-regulatory DNA elements of these genes. For hedgehog, we could identify a cis-regulatory element, ic-CRE, that mediates expression specifically in the posterior part of the intercalary segment and requires promoter-specific interaction for its function. The intercalary stripe is the last part of the metameric hedgehog expression pattern that appears during embryonic development, which probably reflects the late and distinct establishment of this segment. The identification of a cis-regulatory element that is specific for one head segment supports the mutant-based observation that the expression of segment polarity genes is governed by a unique gene network in each of the procephalic segments. This provides further indication that the anterior-most head segments represent primary segments, which are set up independently, in contrast to the secondary segments of the trunk, which resemble true repetitive units.},

Dawdle (Daw), a divergent TGF-beta superfamily ligand expressed in glia and mesoderm, is required for embryonic motoneuron pathfinding in Drosophila. In daw mutants, ISNb and SNa axons fail to extend completely and are unable to innervate their targets. We find that Daw initiates an activin signaling pathway via the receptors Punt and Baboon (Babo) and the signal-transducer Smad2. Furthermore, mutations in these signaling components display similar axon guidance defects. Cell-autonomous disruption of receptor signaling suggests that Babo is required in motoneurons rather than in muscles or glia. Ectopic ligand expression can rescue the daw phenotype, but has no deleterious effects. Our results indicate that Daw functions in a permissive manner to modulate or enable the growth cone response to other restricted guidance cues, and support a novel role for activin signaling in axon guidance.},

abstract = {The twisted gastrulation (tsg) gene is one of seven known zygotic genes that specify the fate of dorsal cells in Drosophila embryos. Mutations in these genes cause at least some of the cells on the dorsal half of the embryo to adopt more ventral cell fates leading to the proposal that most of these genes participate in establishing, maintaining, or modulating a gradient of a single signaling molecule DECAPENTAPLEGIC (DPP). We have examined the effects of tsg mutations on the development of cuticule elements, expression of a region specific enhancer trap, and patterns of mitotic domains. Mutations of tsg only affect the fate of a narrow strip of dorsal midline cells and do not affect dorsal ectoderm cells. However, the pattern of tsg expression is not coincident with the territories affected by tsg mutations. Structural analysis of the tsg gene reveals features of a secreted protein suggesting an extracellular site of action. The TSG protein bears a weak resemblance to human connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), a TGF-beta-induced protein. We propose that dorsal midline cell fate is specified by the combination of both a TSG and a DPP signal to which the dorsal midline cells are uniquely competent to respond.},

abstract = {Two secreted signaling molecules, wingless (wg) and decapentaplegic (dpp), are required to specify the heart in Drosophila. wg and dpp are also required to specify other cell types within the mesoderm and in many other regions of the embryo. Because the spatial patterns of wg and dpp are dynamic, different populations of mesodermal cells are exposed to different combinations of wg and/or dpp at different times. To determine whether the patterns of wg and dpp expression provide unique positional information for the specification of heart precursors, we altered these patterns. Our data suggest that wg and dpp contribute progressively to the elaboration of the expression pattern of the mesoderm-specific homeobox-containing gene tinman (tin), and that the overlap of wg and dpp at an early stage (9) as well as at a later stage (11) in the presence of tin-expressing cells directs cardiac-specific differentiation. Furthermore, ectopic tin expression in the ectoderm at wg/dpp intersects (the primordia of the thoracic imaginal disks) also leads to cardiac-specific differentiation, suggesting that tin confers mesoderm-specificity to the wg/dpp response. We conclude that ectopic heart can be generated by altering the patterns of wg and dpp within the tin-expressing mesoderm, or by ectopic induction of tin within the wg- and dpp-expressing ectoderm.},

We show that Fgf5's spatio-temporally restricted expression pattern indicates a potentially novel role during inner ear development. Fgf6 and Fgf7, although belonging to different subfamilies with diverged sequences, are expressed in similar patterns within the mesoderm. Alignment of protein sequences and phylogenetic analysis demonstrate that FGF5 and FGF6 are highly conserved between chick, human, mouse and zebrafish.

To unravel which molecular events determine the effective rates, such tissue-level assays have been combined with genetic analysis, high-resolution assays, and models that take into account interactions with receptors, extracellular components and trafficking. Nevertheless, because of the natural and experimental data variability, and the underlying assumptions of transport models, it remains challenging to conclusively distinguish between cellular mechanisms.},

We demonstrate that Tsg and Sog play essential roles in transporting Dpp to the dorsal-most cells. Furthermore, we provide biochemical and genetic evidence that a heterodimer of Dpp and Scw, but not the Dpp homodimer, is the primary transported ligand and that the heterodimer signals synergistically through the two type I BMP receptors Tkv and Sax. We propose that the use of broadly distributed Dpp homodimers and spatially restricted Dpp/Scw heterodimers produces the biphasic signal that is responsible for specifying the two dorsal tissue types. Finally, we demonstrate mathematically that heterodimer levels can be less sensitive to changes in gene dosage than homodimers, thereby providing further selective advantage for using heterodimers as morphogens.},

FGF signaling activity is regulated by the binding specificity of ligands and receptors and is modulated by extrinsic cofactors such as heparan sulfate proteoglycans. In previous studies, we have engineered BaF3 cell lines to express the seven principal FGFRs and used these cell lines to determine the receptor binding specificity of FGFs 1-9 by using relative mitogenic activity as the readout. Here we have extended these semiquantitative studies to assess the receptor binding specificity of the remaining FGFs 10-23. This study completes the mitogenesis-based comparison of receptor specificity of the entire FGF family under standard conditions and should help in interpreting and predicting in vivo biological activity.},

abstract = {Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) frequently fulfill prominent roles in the regulation of cell migration in various contexts. In Drosophila, the FGF8-like ligands Pyramus (Pyr) and Thisbe (Ths), which signal through their receptor Heartless (Htl), are known to regulate early mesodermal cell migration after gastrulation as well as glial cell migration during eye development. Herein, we show that Pyr and Ths also exert key roles during the long-distance migration of a specific sub-population of mesodermal cells that migrate from the caudal visceral mesoderm within stereotypic bilateral paths along the trunk visceral mesoderm toward the anterior. These cells constitute the founder myoblasts of the longitudinal midgut muscles. In a forward genetic screen for regulators of this morphogenetic process we identified loss of function alleles for pyr. We show that pyr and ths are expressed along the paths of migration in the trunk visceral mesoderm and endoderm and act largely redundantly to help guide the founder myoblasts reliably onto and along their substrate of migration. Ectopically-provided Pyr and Ths signals can efficiently re-rout the migrating cells, both in the presence and absence of endogenous signals. Our data indicate that the guidance functions of these FGFs must act in concert with other important attractive or adhesive activities of the trunk visceral mesoderm. Apart from their guidance functions, the Pyr and Ths signals play an obligatory role for the survival of the migrating cells. Without these signals, essentially all of these cells enter cell death and detach from the migration substrate during early migration. We present experiments that allowed us to dissect the roles of these FGFs as guidance cues versus trophic activities during the migration of the longitudinal visceral muscle founders.},
annote = {simmilar with the Stathopolous paper, the difference is that they propose that ths and pyr have redundant properties, and that the regulation is more about quantity of the signal that about differential properties of individual vs coexpresed ligand expression.

abstract = {The TGF-$\beta$ signaling pathway is a metazoan-specific intercellular signaling pathway known to be important in many developmental and cellular processes in a wide variety of animals. We investigated the complexity and possible functions of this pathway in a member of one of the earliest branching metazoan phyla, the ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi. A search of the recently sequenced Mnemiopsis genome revealed an inventory of genes encoding ligands and the rest of the components of the TGF-$\beta$ superfamily signaling pathway. The Mnemiopsis genome contains nine TGF-$\beta$ ligands, two TGF-$\beta$-like family members, two BMP-like family members, and five gene products that were unable to be classified with certainty. We also identified four TGF-$\beta$ receptors: three Type I and a single Type II receptor. There are five genes encoding Smad proteins (Smad2, Smad4, Smad6, and two Smad1s). While we have identified many of the other components of this pathway, including Tolloid, SMURF, and Nomo, notably absent are SARA and all of the known antagonists belonging to the Chordin, Follistatin, Noggin, and CAN families. This pathway likely evolved early in metazoan evolution as nearly all components of this pathway have yet to be identified in any non-metazoan. The complement of TGF-$\beta$ signaling pathway components of ctenophores is more similar to that of the sponge, Amphimedon, than to cnidarians, Trichoplax, or bilaterians. The mRNA expression patterns of key genes revealed by in situ hybridization suggests that TGF-$\beta$ signaling is not involved in ctenophore early axis specification. Four ligands are expressed during gastrulation in ectodermal micromeres along all three body axes, suggesting a role in transducing earlier maternal signals. Later expression patterns and experiments with the TGF-$\beta$ inhibitor SB432542 suggest roles in pharyngeal morphogenesis and comb row organization.},

abstract = {Understanding the function and evolution of developmental regulatory networks requires the characterisation and quantification of spatio-temporal gene expression patterns across a range of systems and species. However, most high-throughput methods to measure the dynamics of gene expression do not preserve the detailed spatial information needed in this context. For this reason, quantification methods based on image bioinformatics have become increasingly important over the past few years. Most available approaches in this field either focus on the detailed and accurate quantification of a small set of gene expression patterns, or attempt high-throughput analysis of spatial expression through binary pattern extraction and large-scale analysis of the resulting datasets. Here we present a robust, "medium-throughput" pipeline to process in situ hybridisation patterns from embryos of different species of flies. It bridges the gap between high-resolution, and high-throughput image processing methods, enabling us to quantify graded expression patterns along the antero-posterior axis of the embryo in an efficient and straightforward manner. Our method is based on a robust enzymatic (colorimetric) in situ hybridisation protocol and rapid data acquisition through wide-field microscopy. Data processing consists of image segmentation, profile extraction, and determination of expression domain boundary positions using a spline approximation. It results in sets of measured boundaries sorted by gene and developmental time point, which are analysed in terms of expression variability or spatio-temporal dynamics. Our method yields integrated time series of spatial gene expression, which can be used to reverse-engineer developmental gene regulatory networks across species. It is easily adaptable to other processes and species, enabling the in silico reconstitution of gene regulatory networks in a wide range of developmental contexts.},

abstract = {Understanding the diversification of phenotypes through time--"descent with modification"--has been the focus of evolutionary biology for 150 years. If, contrary to expectations, similarity evolves in unrelated taxa, researchers are guided to uncover the genetic and developmental mechanisms responsible. Similar phenotypes may be retained from common ancestry (homology), but a phylogenetic context may instead reveal that they are independently derived, due to convergence or parallel evolution, or less likely, that they experienced reversal. Such examples of homoplasy present opportunities to discover the foundations of morphological traits. A common underlying mechanism may exist, and components may have been redeployed in a way that produces the "same" phenotype. New, robust phylogenetic hypotheses and molecular, genomic, and developmental techniques enable integrated exploration of the mechanisms by which similarity arises.},

abstract = {Most traditional views of homology rely on two unwarranted premises: the pervasively hierarchical nature of biology, inclusive of the levels of genes, development, and morphology and the linear mapping of genes onto developmental schedules and of developmental schedules onto phenotypes. These premises are only occasionally verified. Hierarchical behavior is negated by gene duplication and exon shuffling at the level of genes, by the coexistence of autonomous vs nonautonomous gene expression at the level of development, by ontogenetic repatterning at the level of morphology. The linearity of mapping of genes onto development is disturbed by genetic piracy, uncoupling of positional vs spatial control, and pleiotropy. The independence of developmental modules affects the mapping of development onto morphology and, finally, the peculiar topology of the epigenetic code affects the linearity of the gene to phenotype mapping. To cope with this complex behavior, a combinatorial approach to homology is recommended.},

abstract = {The recognition of correspondences has long been a fundamental activity among systematists. Advocates of Naturphilosophie, such as Lorenz Oken, drew far-fetched analogies between taxonomic groups and all sorts of other things, including the Persons of the Trinity. They treated change through time either as analogous to an ontogeny or as the product of divinely instituted laws of nature. Darwin changed things by making the taxonomic units strictly historical, implying that they are not classes but rather individuals in a broad metaphysical sense. That means that taxa are concrete, particular things, or wholes made up of parts which are themselves individuals, and that there are no laws of nature for them. Homology is a relationship of correspondence between parts of organisms that are also parts of populations and lineages. It is not a relationship of similarity, and unlike similarity it is transitive. Analogy is a relationship of correspondence between parts of organisms that are members of classes, and is not necessarily due to function. Taxa, like other individuals, can change indefinitely, and the only thing that they must share is a common ancestor. They do not share an essence, Platonic Idea or Bauplan, although "conservative characters" may be widespread in them. Iterative homology likewise is a relationship of correspondence, but the nature of that correspondence remains unclear. The difficulties of the homology concept can be overcome by treating phylogenetics and comparative biology in general as historical narrative.},

abstract = {The close mapping between genotype and morphological phenotype in many contemporary metazoans has led to the general notion that the evolution of organismal form is a direct consequence of evolving genetic programs. In contrast to this view, we propose that the present relationship between genes and form is a highly derived condition, a product of evolution rather than its precondition. Prior to the biochemical canalization of developmental pathways, and the stabilization of phenotypes, interaction of multicellular organisms with their physicochemical environments dictated a many-to-many mapping between genomes and forms. These forms would have been generated by epigenetic mechanisms: initially physical processes characteristic of condensed, chemically active materials, and later conditional, inductive interactions among the organism's constituent tissues. This concept, that epigenetic mechanisms are the generative agents of morphological character origination, helps to explain findings that are difficult to reconcile with the standard neo-Darwinian model, e.g., the burst of body plans in the early Cambrian, the origins of morphological innovation, homology, and rapid change of form. Our concept entails a new interpretation of the relationship between genes and biological form.},

Another study advocates abolishing the term parallelism and treating all cases of the independent evolution of characters as convergence. With the sophistication of modern genomics and genetic analysis, parallelism of characters of the phenotype is being discovered to reflect parallel genetic evolution. Approaching parallelism from developmental and genetic perspectives enables us to tease out the degree to which the reuse of pathways represent deep homology and is a major task for evolutionary developmental biology in the coming decades.},

abstract = {Organisms exhibit an incredible diversity of form, a fact that makes the evolution of novelty seemingly self-evident. However, despite the "obvious" case for novelty, defining this concept in evolutionary terms is highly problematic, so much so that some have suggested discarding it altogether. Approaches to this problem tend to take either an adaptation- or development-based perspective, but we argue here that an exclusive focus on either of these misses the original intent of the novelty concept and undermines its practical utility. We propose instead that for a feature to be novel, it must have evolved both by a transition between adaptive peaks on the fitness landscape and that this transition must have overcome a previous developmental constraint. This definition focuses novelty on the explanation of apparently difficult or low-probability evolutionary transitions and highlights how the integration of developmental and functional considerations are necessary to evolutionary explanation. It further reinforces that novelty is a central concern not just of evolutionary developmental biology (i.e., "evo-devo") but of evolutionary biology more generally. We explore this definition of novelty in light of four examples that range from the obvious to subtle. J. Exp. Zool. (Mol. Dev.

I then focus on the third and main aim of this essay and ask: what conceptual and empirical opportunities exist that would permit evodevo research to transcend the traditional boundaries inherited from its parent disciplines and to move toward the development of a more comprehensive and realistic theory of developmental evolution? Here, I focus on three conceptual frameworks, the theory of facilitated variation, the theory of evolution by genetic accommodation, and the theory of niche construction. I conclude that combined they provide a rich, interlocking framework within which to revise existing and develop novel empirical approaches toward a better understanding of the nature of developmental evolution.

With regard to morphological characters, however, Mendelian inheritance is the exception rather than the rule, and neo-Darwinian mechanisms in any case do not account for the origination (as opposed to the inherited variation) of such characters. It is proposed, therefore, that multicellular organisms passed through a pre-Mendelian, pre-Darwinian phase, whereby cells, genes and gene products constituted complex systems with context-dependent, self-organizing morphogenetic capabilities. An example is provided of a plausible 'core' mechanism for the development of the vertebrate limb that is both inherently pattern forming and morphogenetically plastic. It is suggested that most complex multicellular structures originated from such systems. The notion that genes are privileged determinants of biological characters can only be sustained by neglecting questions of evolutionary origination and the evolution of developmental mechanisms.},

abstract = {The study of mammalian evolution depends greatly on understanding the evolution of teeth and the relationship of tooth shape to diet. Links between gross tooth shape, function and diet have been proposed since antiquity, stretching from Aristotle to Cuvier, Owen and Osborn. So far, however, the possibilities for exhaustive, quantitative comparisons between greatly different tooth shapes have been limited. Cat teeth and mouse teeth, for example, are fundamentally distinct in shape and structure as a result of independent evolutionary change over tens of millions of years. There is difficulty in establishing homology between their tooth components or in summarizing their tooth shapes, yet both carnivorans and rodents possess a comparable spectrum of dietary specializations from animals to plants. Here we introduce homology-free techniques to measure the phenotypic complexity of the three-dimensional shape of tooth crowns. In our geographic information systems (GIS) analysis of 441 teeth from 81 species of carnivorans and rodents, we show that the surface complexity of tooth crowns directly reflects the foods they consume. Moreover, the absolute values of dental complexity for individual dietary classes correspond between carnivorans and rodents, illustrating a high-level similarity between overall tooth shapes despite a lack of low-level similarity of specific tooth components. These results suggest that scale-independent forces have determined the high-level dental shape in lineages that are widely divergent in size, ecology and life history. This link between diet and phenotype will be useful for inferring the ecology of extinct species and illustrates the potential of fast-throughput, high-level analysis of the phenotype.},

Results
For carnivorans all methods show significant diff between categories.
For rodents only the OPC.


OPC shows a nice trend of increasing complexity from hypercarnivoran to herbivoran diet. With overlapping values of the same categories in the different groups.


IMPORTANCE:
OPC reflects a high level simmilarity between carnivoran and rodents (depending on the diet) independent of the extensive differences in low-level simmilarities (size, teeth number, replacing, chewing motion).
Indicate scale-independent and phylogeny-independent effects of diets on general aspects of dental shape.

Nice extra: 
They argue that the mismatch of Ursus maritimus, in respect with their group, is due to the recent diveregence from Ursus arctos (200kyr) with morphological diveregence only for the last (20-40yr). Some trend is nevertheless found.
This relates to the question of how quickly aspects of dental complexity res{\aa}pond to shift in diet.},

abstract = {Synthetic biology has advanced the design of standardized control devices that program cellular functions and metabolic activities in living organisms. Rational interconnection of these synthetic switches resulted in increasingly complex designer networks that execute input-triggered genetic instructions with precision, robustness and computational logic reminiscent of electronic circuits. Using trigger-controlled transcription factors, which independently control gene expression, and RNA-binding proteins that inhibit the translation of transcripts harbouring specific RNA target motifs, we have designed a set of synthetic transcription–translation control devices that could be rewired in a plug-and-play manner. Here we show that these combinatorial circuits integrated a two-molecule input and performed digital computations with NOT, AND, NAND and N-IMPLY expression logic in single mammalian cells. Functional interconnection of two N-IMPLY variants resulted in bitwise intracellular XOR operations, and a combinatorial arrangement of three logic gates enabled independent cells to perform programmable half-subtractor and half-adder calculations. Individual mammalian cells capable of executing basic molecular arithmetic functions isolated or coordinated to metabolic activities in a predictable, precise and robust manner may provide new treatment strategies and bio-electronic interfaces in future gene-based and cell-based therapies.},

Morphometric analyses are revealing that development mediates complex interactions between genetic and environmental factors affecting shape. Evolution results from changes in those interactions, as natural selection favours shapes that more effectively perform some fitness-related functions. Quantitative studies of shape can characterize developmental and genetic effects and discover their relative importance. They integrate evo-devo and related disciplines into a coherent understanding of evolutionary processes from populations to large-scale evolutionary radiations.},

abstract = {Many scientists and philosophers of science are troubled by the relative isolation of developmental from evolutionary biology. Reconciling the science of development with the science of heredity preoccupied a minority of biologists for much of the twentieth century, but these efforts were not corporately successful. Mainly in the past fifteen years, however, these previously dispersed integrating programmes have been themselves synthesized and so reinvigorated. Two of these more recent synthesizing endeavours are evolutionary developmental biology (EDB, or "evo-devo") and developmental systems theory (DST). While the former is a bourgeoning and scientifically well-respected biological discipline, the same cannot be said of DST, which is virtually unknown among biologists. In this review, we provide overviews of DST and EDB, summarize their key tenets, examine how they relate to one another and to the study of epigenetics, and survey the impact that DST and EDB have had (and in future should have) on biological theory and practice.},

Here we used RNA-Seq, tiling microarrays and cDNA sequencing to explore the transcriptome in 30 distinct developmental stages. We identified 111,195 new elements, including thousands of genes, coding and non-coding transcripts, exons, splicing and editing events, and inferred protein isoforms that previously eluded discovery using established experimental, prediction and conservation-based approaches. These data substantially expand the number of known transcribed elements in the Drosophila genome and provide a high-resolution view of transcriptome dynamics throughout development.},

One can distinguish physicochemical, selective, genetic and developmental causes of such constraints. Here, I discuss these causes in three classes of system that bring forth many phenotypic traits and evolutionary innovations: regulatory circuits, macromolecules and metabolic networks. In these systems, genotypes with the same phenotype form large genotype networks that extend throughout a vast genotype space. Such genotype networks can help unify different causes of evolutionary constraints. They can show that these causes ultimately emerge from the process of development; that is, how phenotypes form from genotypes. Furthermore, they can explain important consequences of constraints, such as punctuated stasis and canalization.},

In this paper, early retinal development is discussed with respect to the structure formation of the optic cup. Although recent studies have elucidated molecular mechanisms of retinal differentiation, little is known about how the unique shape of the optic cup is determined. A recent report has demonstrated that optic-cup morphogenesis spontaneously occurs in three-dimensional stem-cell culture without external forces, indicating a latent intrinsic order to generate the structure. Based on this self-organizing phenomenon, we introduce the "relaxation-expansion" model to mechanically interpret the tissue dynamics that enable the spontaneous invagination of the neural retina. This model involves three consecutive local rules (relaxation, apical constriction, and expansion), and its computer simulation recapitulates the optic-cup morphogenesis in silico.},

It is a well-known fact that non-rigid image registration techniques may converge poorly if the initial position is not sufficiently near to the solution. A common approach to address this problem is to perform a time consuming rigid pre-registration step. In this paper we show that the new curvature registration not only produces accurate and smooth solutions but also allows for an automatic rigid alignment. Thus, in contrast to other popular registration schemes, the new method no longer requires a pre-registration step. Furthermore, we present an implementation of the new scheme based on the numerical solution of the underlying Euler-Lagrange equations. The real discrete cosine transform is the backbone of our implementation and leads to a stable and fast O(N log N) algorithm, where N denotes the number of voxels. Finally, we report on some numerical test runs.},

It uses an explicit spline representation of the images in conjunction with spline processing, and is based on a coarse-to-fine iterative strategy (pyramid approach). The minimization is performed according to a new variation (ML*) of the Marquardt-Levenberg algorithm for nonlinear least-square optimization. The geometric deformation model is a global three-dimensional (3-D) affine transformation that can be optionally restricted to rigid-body motion (rotation and translation), combined with isometric scaling. It also includes an optional adjustment of image contrast differences. We obtain excellent results for the registration of intramodality positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. We conclude that the multiresolution refinement strategy is more robust than a comparable single-stage method, being less likely to be trapped into a false local optimum. In addition, our improved version of the Marquardt-Levenberg algorithm is faster.},

abstract = {Staged embryonic series are important as reference for different kinds of biological studies. I summarise problems that occur when using 'staging tables' of 'model organisms'. Investigations of developmental processes in a broad scope of taxa are becoming commonplace. Beginning in the 1990s, methods were developed to quantify and analyse developmental events in a phylogenetic framework. The algorithms associated with these methods are still under development, mainly due to difficulties of using non-independent characters. Nevertheless, the principle of comparing clearly defined newly occurring morphological features in development (events) in quantifying analyses was a key innovation for comparative embryonic research. Up to date no standard was set for how to define such events in a comparative approach. As a case study I compared the external development of 23 land vertebrate species with a focus on turtles, mainly based on reference staging tables. I excluded all the characters that are only identical for a particular species or general features that were only analysed in a few species. Based on these comparisons I defined 104 developmental characters that are common either for all vertebrates (61 characters), gnathostomes (26), tetrapods (3), amniotes (7), or only for sauropsids (7). Characters concern the neural tube, somite, ear, eye, limb, maxillary and mandibular process, pharyngeal arch, eyelid or carapace development. I present an illustrated guide listing all the defined events. This guide can be used for describing developmental series of any vertebrate species or for documenting specimen variability of a particular species. The guide incorporates drawings and photographs as well as consideration of species identifying developmental features such as colouration. The simple character-code of the guide is extendable to further characters pertaining to external and internal morphological, physiological, genetic or molecular development, and also for other vertebrate groups not examined here, such as Chondrichthyes or Actinopterygii. An online database to type in developmental events for different stages and species could be a basis for further studies in comparative embryology. By documenting developmental events with the standard code, sequence heterochrony studies (i.e. Parsimov) and studies on variability can use this broad comparative data set.},

abstract = {Embryos of different species of vertebrate share a common organisation and often look similar. Adult differences among species become more apparent through divergence at later stages. Some authors have suggested that members of most or all vertebrate clades pass through a virtually identical, conserved stage. This idea was promoted by Haeckel, and has recently been revived in the context of claims regarding the universality of developmental mechanisms. Thus embryonic resemblance at the tailbud stage has been linked with a conserved pattern of developmental gene expression - the zootype. Haeckel's drawings of the external morphology of various vertebrates remain the most comprehensive comparative data purporting to show a conserved stage. However, their accuracy has been questioned and only a narrow range of species was illustrated. In view of the current widespread interest in evolutionary developmental biology, and especially in the conservation of developmental mechanisms, re-examination of the extent of variation in vertebrate embryos is long overdue. We present here the first review of the external morphology of tailbud embryos, illustrated with original specimens from a wide range of vertebrate groups. We find that embryos at the tailbud stage - thought to correspond to a conserved stage - show variations in form due to allometry, heterochrony, and differences in body plan and somite number. These variations foreshadow important differences in adult body form. Contrary to recent claims that all vertebrate embryos pass through a stage when they are the same size, we find a greater than 10-fold variation in greatest length at the tailbud stage. Our survey seriously undermines the credibility of Haeckel's drawings, which depict not a conserved stage for vertebrates, but a stylised amniote embryo. In fact, the taxonomic level of greatest resemblance among vertebrate embryos is below the subphylum. The wide variation in morphology among vertebrate embryos is difficult to reconcile with the idea of a phyogenetically-conserved tailbud stage, and suggests that at least some developmental mechanisms are not highly constrained by the zootype. Our study also highlights the dangers of drawing general conclusions about vertebrate development from studies of gene expression in a small number of laboratory species.},

abstract = {Vertebrate embryos pass through a period of morphological similarity, the phylotypic period. Since Haeckel's biogenetic law of recapitulation, proximate and ultimate evolutionary causes of such similarity of embryos were discussed. We test predictions about changes in phenotypic and genetic variances that were derived from three hypotheses about the evolutionary origin of the phylotypic stage, i.e. random, epigenetic effects, and stabilizing selection. The random hypothesis predicts increasing values for phenotypic variances and stable or increasing values for genetic variances; the epigenetic effects hypothesis predicts declining values for phenotypic variances but stable or increasing values of genetic variances, and the stabilizing selection predicts stable phenotypic variances but decreasing genetic variances. We studied zebrafish as a model species, because it can be bred in large numbers as necessary for a quantitative genetics breeding design. A half-sib breeding scheme provided estimates of additive genetic variances from 11 embryonic characters from 12 through to 24 hr after fertilization, i.e. before, during (15-19 hr), and after the phylotypic period. Because additive genetic variances are size dependent, we calculated narrow-sense heritabilities as a size independent gauge of genetic contributions to the phenotype. The results show declining phenotypic variances and stable heritabilities. In conclusion, we reject the random and the stabilizing selection hypotheses and favor ideas about epigenetic effects that constrain the early embryonic development. Additive genetic variance during the phylotypic stage makes it accessible for evolution, thus explaining in a simple and straightforward way why the phylotypic period differs among vertebrates in timing, duration, and morphologies.},

abstract = {The observation that animal morphology tends to be conserved during the embryonic phylotypic period (a period of maximal similarity between the species within each animal phylum) led to the proposition that embryogenesis diverges more extensively early and late than in the middle, known as the hourglass model. This pattern of conservation is thought to reflect a major constraint on the evolution of animal body plans. Despite a wealth of morphological data confirming that there is often remarkable divergence in the early and late embryos of species from the same phylum, it is not yet known to what extent gene expression evolution, which has a central role in the elaboration of different animal forms, underpins the morphological hourglass pattern. Here we address this question using species-specific microarrays designed from six sequenced Drosophila species separated by up to 40 million years. We quantify divergence at different times during embryogenesis, and show that expression is maximally conserved during the arthropod phylotypic period. By fitting different evolutionary models to each gene, we show that at each time point more than 80{\%} of genes fit best to models incorporating stabilizing selection, and that for genes whose evolutionarily optimal expression level is the same across all species, selective constraint is maximized during the phylotypic period. The genes that conform most to the hourglass pattern are involved in key developmental processes. These results indicate that natural selection acts to conserve patterns of gene expression during mid-embryogenesis, and provide a genome-wide insight into the molecular basis of the hourglass pattern of developmental evolution.},

Here we perform a quantitative comparative transcriptome analysis of several model vertebrate embryos and show that the pharyngula stage is most conserved, whereas earlier and later stages are rather divergent.

abstract = {Parallels between phylogeny and ontogeny have been discussed for almost two centuries, and a number of theories have been proposed to explain such patterns. Especially elusive is the phylotypic stage, a phase during development where species within a phylum are particularly similar to each other. Although this has formerly been interpreted as a recapitulation of phylogeny, it is now thought to reflect an ontogenetic progression phase, where strong constraints on developmental regulation and gene interactions exist. Several studies have shown that genes expressed during this stage evolve at a slower rate, but it has so far not been possible to derive an unequivocal molecular signature associated with this stage. Here we use a combination of phylostratigraphy and stage-specific gene expression data to generate a cumulative index that reflects the evolutionary age of the transcriptome at given ontogenetic stages. Using zebrafish ontogeny and adult development as a model, we find that the phylotypic stage does indeed express the oldest transcriptome set and that younger sets are expressed during early and late development, thus faithfully mirroring the hourglass model of morphological divergence. Reproductively active animals show the youngest transcriptome, with major differences between males and females. Notably, ageing animals express increasingly older genes. Comparisons with similar data sets from flies and nematodes show that this pattern occurs across phyla. Our results indicate that an old transcriptome marks the phylotypic phase and that phylogenetic differences at other ontogenetic stages correlate with the expression of newly evolved genes.},

Currently, investigators must visually inspect numerous images containing embryonic expression patterns to identify spatially similar patterns for inferring potential genetic interactions. The lack of a computational approach to identify pattern similarities is an impediment to advancement in developmental biology research because of the rapidly increasing amount of available embryonic gene expression data. Therefore, we have developed computational approaches to automate the comparison of gene expression patterns contained in images of early stage Drosophila melanogaster embryos (prior to the beginning of germ-band elongation); similarities and differences in gene expression patterns in these early stages have extensive developmental effects. Here we describe a basic expression search tool (BEST) to retrieve best matching expression patterns for a given query expression pattern and a computational device for gene interaction inference using gene expression pattern images and information on the associated genotypes and probes. Analysis of a prototype collection of Drosophila gene expression pattern images is presented to demonstrate the utility of these methods in identifying biologically meaningful matches and inferring gene interactions by direct image content analysis. In particular, the use of BEST searches for gene expression patterns is akin to that of BLAST searches for finding similar sequences. These computational developmental biology methodologies are likely to make the great wealth of embryonic gene expression pattern data easily accessible and to accelerate the discovery of developmental networks.},

abstract = {Migration is a complex, dynamic process that has largely been studied using qualitative or static approaches. As technology has improved, we can now take quantitative approaches towards understanding cell migration using in vivo imaging and tracking analyses. In this manner, we have established a four-step model of mesoderm migration during Drosophila gastrulation: (I) mesodermal tube formation, (II) collapse of the mesoderm, (III) dorsal migration and spreading and (IV) monolayer formation. Our data provide evidence that these steps are temporally distinct and that each might require different chemical inputs. To support this, we analyzed the role of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling, in particular the function of two Drosophila FGF ligands, Pyramus and Thisbe, during mesoderm migration. We determined that FGF signaling through both ligands controls movements in the radial direction. Thisbe is required for the initial collapse of the mesoderm onto the ectoderm, whereas both Pyramus and Thisbe are required for monolayer formation. In addition, we uncovered that the GTPase Rap1 regulates radial movement of cells and localization of the beta-integrin subunit, Myospheroid, which is also required for monolayer formation. Our analyses suggest that distinct signals influence particular movements, as we found that FGF signaling is involved in controlling collapse and monolayer formation but not dorsal movement, whereas integrins are required to support monolayer formation only and not earlier movements. Our work demonstrates that complex cell migration is not necessarily a fluid process, but suggests instead that different types of movements are directed by distinct inputs in a stepwise manner.},

abstract = {Idealization is a reasoning strategy that biologists use to describe, model and explain that purposefully departs from features known to be present in nature. Similar to other strategies of scientific reasoning, idealization combines distinctive strengths alongside of latent weaknesses. The study of ontogeny in model organisms is usually executed by establishing a set of normal stages for embryonic development, which enables researchers in different laboratory contexts to have standardized comparisons of experimental results. Normal stages are a form of idealization because they intentionally ignore known variation in development, including variation associated with phenotypic plasticity (e.g. via strict control of environmental variables). This is a tension between the phenomenon of plasticity and the practice of staging that has consequences for evolutionary developmental investigation because variation is conceptually removed as a part of rendering model organisms experimentally tractable. Two compensatory tactics for mitigating these consequences are discussed: employing a diversity of model organisms and adopting alternative periodizations.},

abstract = {Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling controls a vast array of biological processes including cell differentiation and migration, wound healing and malignancy. In vertebrates, FGF signaling is complex, with over 100 predicted FGF ligand-receptor combinations. Drosophila melanogaster presents a simpler model system in which to study FGF signaling, with only three ligands and two FGF receptors (FGFRs) identified. Here we analyze the specificity of FGFR [Heartless (Htl) and Breathless (Btl)] activation by each of the FGF ligands [Pyramus (Pyr), Thisbe (Ths) and Branchless (Bnl)] in Drosophila. We confirm that both Pyr and Ths can activate Htl, and that only Bnl can activate Btl. To examine the role of each ligand in supporting activation of the Htl FGFR, we utilize genetic approaches that focus on the earliest stages of embryonic development. When pyr and ths are equivalently expressed using the Gal4 system, these ligands support qualitatively different FGFR signaling responses. Both Pyr and Ths function in a non-autonomous fashion to support mesoderm spreading during gastrulation, but Pyr exhibits a longer functional range. pyr and ths single mutants exhibit defects in mesoderm spreading during gastrulation, yet only pyr mutants exhibit severe defects in dorsal mesoderm specification. We demonstrate that the Drosophila FGFs have different activities and that cell migration and differentiation have different ligand requirements. Furthermore, these FGF ligands are not regulated solely by differential expression, but the sequences of these linked genes have evolved to serve different functions. We contend that inherent properties of FGF ligands make them suitable to support specific FGF-dependent processes, and that FGF ligands are not always interchangeable.},

FGFs are best known for their roles in the early steps of patterning of the neural primordium and proliferation of neural progenitors. However, other equally important functions have emerged more recently, including in the later steps of neuronal migration, axon navigation, and synaptogenesis. We review here these diverse functions and discuss the mechanisms that account for this unusual range of activities.

abstract = {When it comes to mouse evo-devo, the fourth premolar-first molar (P4-M1) dental complex becomes a source of longstanding controversies among paleontologists and biologists. Muroidea possess only molar teeth but with additional mesial cusps on their M1. Developmental studies tend to demonstrate that the formation of such mesial cusps could result from the integration of a P4 germ into M1 during odontogenesis. Conversely, most Dipodoidea conserve their fourth upper premolars and those that lost these teeth can also bear additional mesial cusps on their first upper molars. The aim of this study is to assess this developmental model in both Muroidea and Dipodoidea by documenting the morphological evolution of the P4-M1 complex across 50 Ma. Fourteen extinct and extant species, including abnormal and mutant specimens were investigated. We found that, even if their dental evolutionary pathways strongly differ, Dipodoidea and Muroidea retain common developmental characteristics because some of them can present similar dental morphological trends. It also appears that the acquisition of a mesial cusp on M1 is independent from the loss of P4 in both superfamilies. Actually, the progressive decrease of the inhibitory effect of P4, consequent to its regression, could allow the M1 to lengthen and mesial cusps to grow in Muroidea. Apart from these developmental explanations, patternings of the mesial part of first molars are also deeply constrained by morpho-functional requirements. As there is no obvious evidence of such mechanisms in Dipodoidea given their more variable dental morphologies, further developmental investigations are needed.},

abstract = {Although flourishing, I argue that evo-devo is not yet a mature scientific discipline. Its philosophical foundation exhibits an internal inconsistency that results from a metaphysical confusion. In modern evolutionary biology, species and other taxa are most commonly considered as individuals. I accept this thesis to be the best available foundation for modern evolutionary biology. However, evo-devo is characterized by a remarkable degree of typological thinking, which instead treats taxa as classes. This metaphysical incompatibility causes much distorted thinking. In this paper, I will discuss the logical implications of accepting the individuality thesis for evo-devo. First, I will illustrate the degree to which typological thinking pervades evo-devo. This ranges from the relatively innocent use of typologically tainted language to the more serious misuse of differences between taxa as evidence against homology and monophyly, and the logically flawed concept of partial homology. Second, I will illustrate how, in a context of typological thinking, evo-devo's harmless preoccupation with distant ancestors has become transformed into a pernicious problem afflicting the choice of model organisms. I will expose the logical flaws underlying the common assumption that model organisms can be expected to represent the clades they are a part of in an unambiguous way. I will expose the logical flaws underlying the general assumption that basal taxa are the best available stand-ins for ancestors and that they best represent the clade of which they are a part, while also allowing for optimal extrapolation of results.},

abstract = {This article considers the role played by a core set of "dynamical patterning modules" (DPMs) in the origination, development and evolution of complex organisms. These consist of the products of a subset of the genes of what has come to be known as the "developmental-genetic toolkit" in association with physical processes they mobilize. The physical processes are those characteristic of chemically and mechanically excitable mesoscopic systems like cell aggregates: cohesion, viscoelasticity, diffusion, spatiotemporal heterogeneity based on activator-inhibitor interaction, and multistable and oscillatory dynamics. We focus on the emergence of the Metazoa, and show how toolkit gene products and pathways that pre-existed the metazoans acquired novel morphogenetic functions simply by virtue of the change in scale and context inherent to multicellularity. We propose that DPMs, acting singly and in combination with each other, constitute a "pattern language" capable of generating all metazoan body plans and organ forms. This concept implies that the multicellular organisms of the late Precambrian-early Cambrian were phenotypically plastic, fluently exploring morphospace in a fashion decoupled from both function-based selection and genotypic change. The relatively stable developmental trajectories and morphological phenotypes of modern organisms, then, are considered to be products of stabilizing selection. This perspective solves the apparent "molecular homology-analogy paradox," whereby widely divergent modern animal types utilize the same molecular toolkit during development, but it does so by inverting the neo-Darwinian principle that phenotypic disparity was generated over long periods of time in concert with, and in proportion to genotypic change.},

abstract = {The evolutionary origin of the egg stage of animal development presents several difficulties for conventional developmental and evolutionary narratives. If the egg's internal organization represents a template for key features of the developed organism, why can taxa within a given phylum exhibit very different egg types, pass through a common intermediate morphology (the so-called "phylotypic stage"), only to diverge again, thus exemplifying the embryonic "hourglass"? Moreover, if different egg types typically represent adaptations to different environmental conditions, why do birds and mammals, for example, have such vastly different eggs with respect to size, shape, and postfertilization dynamics, whereas all these features are more similar for ascidians and mammals? Here, I consider the possibility that different body plans had their origin in self-organizing physical processes in ancient clusters of cells, and suggest that eggs represented a set of independent evolutionary innovations subsequently inserted into the developmental trajectories of such aggregates. I first describe how "dynamical patterning modules" (DPMs) associations between components of the metazoan developmental-genetic toolkit and certain physical processes and effects may have organized primitive animal body plans independently of an egg stage. Next, I describe how adaptive specialization of cells released from such aggregates could have become "proto-eggs," which regenerated the parental cell clusters by cleavage, conserving the characteristic DPMs available to a lineage. Then, I show how known processes of cytoplasmic reorganization following fertilization are often based on spontaneous, self-organizing physical effects ("egg-patterning processes": EPPs). I suggest that rather than acting as developmental blueprints or prepatterns, the EPPs refine the phylotypic body plans determined by the DPMs by setting the boundary and initial conditions under which these multicellular patterning mechanisms operate. Finally, I describe how this new perspective provides a resolution to the embryonic hourglass puzzle.},

abstract = {Knowledge of the genetic control of segmentation in Drosophila has made insect segmentation a paradigmatic case in the study of the evolution of developmental mechanisms. In Drosophila, the patterns of expression of segmentation genes are established simultaneously in all segments by a complex set of interactions between transcriptional factors that diffuse in a syncytium occupying the whole embryo. Such mechanisms cannot act in short germ-band insects where segments appear sequentially from a cellularized posterior proliferative zone. Here, we compare mechanisms of segmentation in different organisms and discuss how the transition between the different types of segmentation can be explained by small and progressive changes in the underlying gene networks. The recent discovery of a temporal oscillation in expression during somitogenesis of vertebrate homologs of the pair-rule gene hairy enhances the plausibility of an earlier proposal that the evolutionary origin of both the short- and long germ-band modes of segmentation was an oscillatory genetic network (Newman 1993). An implication of this scenario is that the self-organizing, pattern-forming system embodied in an oscillatory network operating in the context of a syncytium (i.e., a reaction-diffusion system)-which is hypothesized to have originated the simultaneous mode of segmentation-must have been replaced by the genetic hierarchy seen in modern-day Drosophila over the course of evolution. As demonstrated by the simulations in the accompanying article, the tendency for "emergent" genetic networks, associated with self-organizing processes, to be replaced through natural selection with hierarchical networks is discussed in relation to the evolution of segmentation.},

abstract = {Genotype-phenotype interactions during the evolution of form in multicellular organisms is a complex problem but one that can be aided by computational approaches. We present here a framework within which developmental patterns and their underlying genetic networks can be simulated. Gene networks were chosen to reflect realistic regulatory circuits, including positive and negative feedback control, and the exchange of a subset of gene products between cells, or within a syncytium. Some of these networks generate stable spatial patterns of a subset of their molecular constituents, and can be assigned to categories (e.g., "emergent" or "hierarchic") based on the topology of molecular circuitry. These categories roughly correspond to what has been discussed in the literature as "self-organizing" and "programmed" processes of development. The capability of such networks to form patterns of repeating stripes was studied in network ensembles in which parameters of gene-gene interaction were caused to vary in a manner analogous to genetic mutation. The evolution under mutational change of individual representative networks of each category was also simulated. We have found that patterns with few stripes ({\textless} or =3) are most likely to originate in the form of a hierarchic network, whereas those with greater numbers of stripes ({\textgreater} or =4) originate most readily as emergent networks. However, regardless of how many stripes it contains, once a pattern is established, there appears to be an evolutionary tendency for emergent mechanisms to be replaced by hierarchic mechanisms. These results have potential significance for the understanding of genotype-phenotype relationships in the evolution of metazoan form.},

abstract = {This article suggests that apparent disagreements between the concept of developmental constraints and neo-Darwinian views on morphological evolution can disappear by using a different conceptualization of the interplay between development and selection. A theoretical framework based on current evolutionary and developmental biology and the concepts of variational properties, developmental patterns and developmental mechanisms is presented. In contrast with existing paradigms, the approach in this article is specifically developed to compare developmental mechanisms by the morphological variation they produce and the way in which their functioning can change due to genetic variation. A developmental mechanism is a gene network, which is able to produce patterns in space though the regulation of some cell behaviour (like signalling, mitosis, apoptosis, adhesion, etc.). The variational properties of a developmental mechanism are all the pattern transformations produced under different initial and environmental conditions or IS-mutations. IS-mutations are DNA changes that affect how two genes in a network interact, while T-mutations are mutations that affect the topology of the network itself. This article explains how this new framework allows predictions not only about how pattern formation affects variation, and thus phenotypic evolution, but also about how development evolves by replacement between pattern formation mechanisms. This article presents testable inferences about the evolution of the structure of development and the phenotype under different selective pressures. That is what kind of pattern formation mechanisms, in which relative temporal order, and which kind of phenotypic changes, are expected to be found in development.},

How these different types of morphological changes can be understood from the diversity of developmental mechanisms existing in animal development is explored.

abstract = {Canalization is a concept, introduced by Waddington that describes the reduced sensitivity of a phenotype to genetic and environmental perturbations. Some research in canalization assumes that lack of variation in a trait in one genotype with respect to another genotype in a population, is due to the existence of buffering mechanisms against environmental and/or genetic variation. This article criticizes this assumption and out points out other possible problems with the concepts of canalization, robustness, and evolvability. These involve: the neglect of alternative explanations for the lack of variation in a trait, the incompatibility with current understanding of development, the way the mutivariate nature of morphological variation is considered. In addition, this article tries to explain that these concepts implicitly assume, although not generally acknowledged, that without buffering any genetic or environmental variation should give rise to a distinct phenotypic outcome. This can be avoided by restricting the use of canalization to cases in which, as in hsp90, there is direct evidence of buffering. For the other cases it would be clearer to talk about variational properties or simply type of variation. The concept of evolvability is also biased towards univariate comparisons and is dependent on selective pressures. It is suggested that this can be replaced by "type of phenotypic variation" from a genotype or variational properties. Overall, this article proposes that the concepts of canalization and evolvability involve some assumptions that, in most situations, unnecessarily complicate the study of evolution and development.},

abstract = {This article critically reviews some widespread views about the overall functioning of development. Special attention is devoted to views in developmental genetics about the superstructure of developmental gene networks. According to these views gene networks are hierarchic and multilayered. The highest layers partition the embryo in large coarse areas and control downstream genes that subsequently subdivide the embryo into smaller and smaller areas. These views are criticized on the bases of developmental and evolutionary arguments. First, these views, although detailed at the level of gene identities, do not incorporate morphogenetic mechanisms nor do they try to explain how morphology changes during development. Often, they assume that morphogenetic mechanisms are subordinate to cell signaling events. This is in contradiction to the evidence reviewed herein. Experimental evidence on pattern formation also contradicts the view that developmental gene networks are hierarchically multilayered and that their functioning is decodable from promoter analysis. Simple evolutionary arguments suggest that, indeed, developmental gene networks tend to be non-hierarchic. Re-use leads to extensive modularity in gene networks while developmental drift blurs this modularity. Evolutionary opportunism makes developmental gene networks very dependent on epigenetic factors.},

abstract = {Generation of morphological diversity remains a challenge for evolutionary biologists because it is unclear how an ultimately finite number of genes involved in initial pattern formation integrates with morphogenesis. Ideally, models used to search for the simplest developmental principles on how genes produce form should account for both developmental process and evolutionary change. Here we present a model reproducing the morphology of mammalian teeth by integrating experimental data on gene interactions and growth into a morphodynamic mechanism in which developing morphology has a causal role in patterning. The model predicts the course of tooth-shape development in different mammalian species and also reproduces key transitions in evolution. Furthermore, we reproduce the known expression patterns of several genes involved in tooth development and their dynamics over developmental time. Large morphological effects frequently can be achieved by small changes, according to this model, and similar morphologies can be produced by different changes. This finding may be consistent with why predicting the morphological outcomes of molecular experiments is challenging. Nevertheless, models incorporating morphology and gene activity show promise for linking genotypes to phenotypes.},

abstract = {We present a classification of developmental mechanisms that have been shown experimentally to generate pattern and form in metazoan organisms. We propose that all such mechanisms can be organized into three basic categories and that two of these may act as composite mechanisms in two different ways. The simple categories are cell autonomous mechanisms in which cells enter into specific arrangements ('patterns') without interacting, inductive mechanisms in which cell communication leads to changes in pattern by reciprocal or hierarchical alteration of cell phenotypes ('states') and morphogenetic mechanisms in which pattern changes by means of cell interactions that do not change cell states. The latter two types of mechanism can be combined either morphostatically, in which case inductive mechanisms act first, followed by the morphogenetic mechanism, or morphodynamically, in which case both types of mechanisms interact continuously to modify each other's dynamics. We propose that this previously unexplored distinction in the operation of composite developmental mechanisms provides insight into the dynamics of many developmental processes. In particular, morphostatic and morphodynamic mechanisms respond to small changes in their genetic and microenvironmental components in dramatically different ways. We suggest that these differences in 'variational properties' lead to morphostatic and morphodynamic mechanisms being represented to different extents in early and late stages of development and to their contributing in distinct ways to morphological transitions in evolution.},

abstract = {Here we investigate how development and evolution can affect each other by exploring what kind of phenotypic variation is produced by different types of developmental mechanisms. A limited number of developmental mechanisms are capable of pattern formation in development. Two main types have been identified. In morphodynamic mechanisms, induction events and morphogenetic processes, such as simple growth, act at the same time. In morphostatic mechanisms, induction events happen before morphogenetic mechanisms, and thus growth cannot influence the induction of a pattern. We present a study of the variational properties of these developmental mechanisms that can help to understand how and why a developmental mechanism may become involved in the evolution and development of a particular morphological structure. Using existing models of pattern formation in teeth, an extensive simulation analysis of the phenotypic variation produced by different types of developmental mechanisms is performed. The studied properties include the amount and diversity of the phenotypic variation produced, the complexity of the phenotypic variation produced, and the relationship between phenotype and genotype. These variational properties are so different between different types of mechanisms that the relative involvement of these types of mechanisms in evolutionary innovation and in different stages of development can be estimated. In addition, type of mechanism affects the tempo and mode of morphological evolution. These results suggest that the basic principles by which development is organized can influence the likelihood of morphological evolution.},

abstract = {Studies of mammalian evolution frequently use data derived from the dentition. Dental characters are particularly central for inferring phylogenetic relationships of fossil taxa, of which teeth are often the only recovered part. The use of different aspects of dental morphology as phylogenetic signals implies the independence of dental characters from each other. Here we report, however, that, at least developmentally, most dental characters may be nonindependent. We investigated how three different levels of the cell signalling protein ectodysplasin (Eda) changed dental characters in mouse. We found that with increasing expression levels of this one gene, the number of cusps increases, cusp shapes and positions change, longitudinal crests form, and number of teeth increases. The consistent modification of characters related to lateral placement of cusps can be traced to a small difference in the formation of an early signalling centre at the onset of tooth crown formation. Our results suggest that most aspects of tooth shape have the developmental potential for correlated changes during evolution which may, if not taken into account, obscure phylogenetic history.},

abstract = {The neo-Darwinian paradigm benefits from the assumption that phenotypic variation is gradual and that phenotype and genotype have a relatively simple relationship. These assumptions are historically inherited from the times of the neo-Darwinian synthesis and, consequently, do not include present understanding about development. In this study, understanding about the dynamics of pattern formation is used to explore to that extent phenotypic variation can be expected to be gradual and simply related to molecular variation. Variation in simple phenotypes seems to fit neo-Darwinian assumptions but variation in complex phenotypes does not. Instead, variation in complex phenotypes would have a tendency to relatively less gradual evolution, even at microevolutionary time scales, that would make phylogenetic reconstructions more difficult. In addition, they will have a tendency to exhibit specific trends in innovation rates over group radiations with early accelerations and late decelerations. This work also explores further consequences of these results in our understanding of phenotypic evolution.},

abstract = {A central aim of evolutionary developmental research is to decipher the relative roles of ecological and molecular interactions in explaining biological diversity. Tetrapod teeth show diverse evolutionary patterns with a repeated increase in dental complexity, especially in response to herbivorous habits. Most extensively in mammals, dentition increases in complexity by elaborating morphology of individual teeth rather than increasing the number of teeth. Even though evolution of mammalian dentition is governed by ecology, recent evidence on molecular signalling suggests that many details and even some general evolutionary tendencies may be instigated by development. Specifically, iterative use of the same developmental modules, the enamel knots, may have facilitated developmentally efficient, or economical, elaboration of tooth shapes without substantially compromising the existing morphology. These kinds of developmentally influenced tendencies may be hypothesized to be typical to many organs and systems showing repeated evolutionary patterns.},

abstract = {The relationship between the genotype and the phenotype, or the genotype-phenotype map, is generally approached with the tools of multivariate quantitative genetics and morphometrics. Whereas studies of development and mathematical models of development may offer new insights into the genotype-phenotype map, the challenge is to make them useful at the level of microevolution. Here we report a computational model of mammalian tooth development that combines parameters of genetic and cellular interactions to produce a three-dimensional tooth from a simple tooth primordia. We systematically tinkered with each of the model parameters to generate phenotypic variation and used geometric morphometric analyses to identify, or developmentally ordinate, parameters best explaining population-level variation of real teeth. To model the full range of developmentally possible morphologies, we used a population sample of ringed seals (Phoca hispida ladogensis). Seal dentitions show a high degree of variation, typically linked to the lack of exact occlusion. Our model suggests that despite the complexity of development and teeth, there may be a simple basis for dental variation. Changes in single parameters regulating signalling during cusp development may explain shape variation among individuals, whereas a parameter regulating epithelial growth may explain serial, tooth-to-tooth variation along the jaw. Our study provides a step towards integrating the genotype, development and the phenotype.},

abstract = {The single large rodent incisor in each jaw quadrant is evolutionarily derived from a mammalian ancestor with many small incisors. The embryonic placode giving rise to the mouse incisor is considerably larger than the molar placode, and the question remains whether this large incisor placode is a developmental requisite to make a thick incisor. Here we used in vitro culture system to experiment with the molecular mechanism regulating tooth placode development and how mice have thick incisors. We found that large placodes are prone to disintegration and formation of two to three small incisor placodes. The balance between one large or multiple small placodes was altered through the regulation of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) and Activin signaling. Exogenous Noggin, which inhibits BMP signaling, or exogenous Activin cause the development of two to three incisors. These incisors were more slender than normal incisors. Additionally, two inhibitor molecules, Sostdc1 and Follistatin, which regulate the effects of BMPs and Activin and have opposite expression patterns, are likely to be involved in the incisor placode regulation in vivo. Furthermore, inhibition of BMPs by recombinant Noggin has been previously suggested to cause a change in the tooth identity from the incisor to the molar. This evidence has been used to support a homeobox code in determining tooth identity. Our work provides an alternative interpretation, where the inhibition of BMP signaling can lead to splitting of the large incisor placode and the formation of partly separate incisors, thereby acquiring molar-like morphology without a change in tooth identity.},

abstract = {One of the fascinating aspects of the history of life is the apparent increase in morphological complexity through time, a well known example being mammalian cheek tooth evolution. In contrast, experimental studies of development more readily show a decrease in complexity, again well exemplified by mammalian teeth, in which tooth crown features called cusps are frequently lost in mutant and transgenic mice. Here we report that mouse tooth complexity can be increased substantially by adjusting multiple signalling pathways simultaneously. We cultured teeth in vitro and adjusted ectodysplasin (EDA), activin A and sonic hedgehog (SHH) pathways, all of which are individually required for normal tooth development. We quantified tooth complexity using the number of cusps and a topographic measure of surface complexity. The results show that whereas activation of EDA and activin A signalling, and inhibition of SHH signalling, individually cause subtle to moderate increases in complexity, cusp number is doubled when all three pathways are adjusted in unison. Furthermore, the increase in cusp number does not result from an increase in tooth size, but from an altered primary patterning phase of development. The combination of a lack of complex mutants, the paucity of natural variants with complex phenotypes, and our results of greatly increased dental complexity using multiple pathways, suggests that an increase may be inherently different from a decrease in phenotypic complexity.},

abstract = {The Cretaceous-Paleogene mass extinction approximately 66 million years ago is conventionally thought to have been a turning point in mammalian evolution. Prior to that event and for the first two-thirds of their evolutionary history, mammals were mostly confined to roles as generalized, small-bodied, nocturnal insectivores, presumably under selection pressures from dinosaurs. Release from these pressures, by extinction of non-avian dinosaurs at the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary, triggered ecological diversification of mammals. Although recent individual fossil discoveries have shown that some mammalian lineages diversified ecologically during the Mesozoic era, comprehensive ecological analyses of mammalian groups crossing the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary are lacking. Such analyses are needed because diversification analyses of living taxa allow only indirect inferences of past ecosystems. Here we show that in arguably the most evolutionarily successful clade of Mesozoic mammals, the Multituberculata, an adaptive radiation began at least 20 million years before the extinction of non-avian dinosaurs and continued across the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary. Disparity in dental complexity, which relates to the range of diets, rose sharply in step with generic richness and disparity in body size. Moreover, maximum dental complexity and body size demonstrate an adaptive shift towards increased herbivory. This dietary expansion tracked the ecological rise of angiosperms and suggests that the resources that were available to multituberculates were relatively unaffected by the Cretaceous-Paleogene mass extinction. Taken together, our results indicate that mammals were able to take advantage of new ecological opportunities in the Mesozoic and that at least some of these opportunities persisted through the Cretaceous-Paleogene mass extinction. Similar broad-scale ecomorphological inventories of other radiations may help to constrain the possible causes of mass extinctions.},

We describe a new strategy for solving this problem and apply it to recently published data on early Drosophila melanogaster development. Our method is orders of magnitude faster than current fitting methods and allows us to fit different types of rules for expressing regulatory relationships. Specifically, we use our approach to fit models using a smooth nonlinear formalism for modeling gene regulation (gene circuits) as well as models using logical rules based on activation and repression thresholds for transcription factors. Our technique also allows us to infer regulatory relationships de novo or to test network structures suggested by the literature. We fit a series of models to test several outstanding questions about gap gene regulation, including regulation of and by hunchback and the role of autoactivation. Based on our modeling results and validation against the experimental literature, we propose a revised network structure for the gap gene system. Interestingly, some relationships in standard textbook models of gap gene regulation appear to be unnecessary for or even inconsistent with the details of gap gene expression during wild-type development.},

It is my intention to illustrate how the aims and methodology of modelling have changed from the early beginnings of a theoretical developmental biology in the 1960s to modern-day systems biology. I show that even early modelling attempts addressed interesting and relevant questions, which were not tractable by experimental approaches. Unfortunately, their validation was severely hampered by a lack of specificity and appropriate experimental evidence. There is a simple lesson to be learned from this: we cannot deduce general rules for pattern formation from first principles or spurious reproduction of developmental phenomena. Instead, we must infer such rules (if any) from detailed and accurate studies of specific developmental systems. To achieve this, mathematical modelling must be closely integrated with experimental approaches. I report on progress that has been made in this direction in the past few years and illustrate the kind of novel insights that can be gained from such combined approaches. These insights demonstrate the great potential (and some pitfalls) of an integrative, systems-level investigation of pattern formation.},

abstract = {Discovery of temporal and spatial patterns of gene expression is essential for understanding the regulatory networks and development in multicellular organisms. We analyzed the images from our large-scale spatial expression data set of early Drosophila embryonic development and present a comprehensive computational image analysis of the expression landscape. For this study, we created an innovative virtual representation of embryonic expression patterns using an elliptically shaped mesh grid that allows us to make quantitative comparisons of gene expression using a common frame of reference. Demonstrating the power of our approach, we used gene co-expression to identify distinct expression domains in the early embryo; the result is surprisingly similar to the fate map determined using laser ablation. We also used a clustering strategy to find genes with similar patterns and developed new analysis tools to detect variation within consensus patterns, adjacent non-overlapping patterns, and anti-correlated patterns. Of the 1800 genes investigated, only half had previously assigned functions. The known genes suggest developmental roles for the clusters, and identification of related patterns predicts requirements for co-occurring biological functions.},

@article{Kadam2012,
abstract = {Caudal visceral mesoderm (CVM) cells migrate synchronously towards the anterior of the Drosophila embryo as two distinct groups located on each side of the body, in order to specify longitudinal muscles that ensheath the gut. Little is known about the molecular cues that guide cells along this path, the longest migration of embryogenesis, except that they closely associate with trunk visceral mesoderm (TVM). The expression of the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) heartless and its ligands, pyramus (pyr) and thisbe (ths), within CVM and TVM cells, respectively, suggested FGF signaling may influence CVM cell guidance. In FGF mutants, CVM cells die before reaching the anterior region of the TVM. However, an earlier phenotype observed was that the two cell clusters lose direction and converge at the midline. Live in vivo imaging and tracking analyses identified that the movements of CVM cells were slower and no longer synchronous. Moreover, CVM cells were found to cross over from one group to the other, disrupting bilateral symmetry, whereas such mixing was never observed in wild-type embryos. Ectopic expression of either Pyr or Ths was sufficient to redirect CVM cell movement, but only when the endogenous source of these ligands was absent. Collectively, our results show that FGF signaling regulates directional movement of CVM cells and that native presentation of both FGF ligands together is most effective at attracting cells. This study also has general implications, as it suggests that the activity supported by two FGF ligands in concert differs from their activities in isolation.},
